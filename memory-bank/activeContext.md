## Current Goals

- Prioritize KG J-only energy-oscillation QC (Störmer–Verlet: ΔE amplitude ∝ Δt^2 + strict time-reversal) followed by Passive Thermodynamic Routing (No-Switch) v2 with RJ fit, collapse-windowing, no-switch identity, and routing/energy-floor metrics; keep J⊕M on hold until conservative limb is stamped.
