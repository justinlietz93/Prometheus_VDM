# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-06 | Added minimal RD conservation harness run_rd_conservation.py using IO helper. | Implements initial controls: diffusion-only mass conservation and reaction-only Q-invariant convergence (RK4); logs artifacts under standardized outputs; aligns with periodic BC default for Obj-A/B. |
| 2025-10-06 | Cleaned and deduplicated rd_conservation harness file; fixed embedded duplication and trailing stray code; ensured sidecar JSON/CSV outputs and CLI are intact. | Prior patch corruption embedded a duplicate script block inside StepSpec and left stray print at EOF. The cleanup restores a single, valid module and preserves experimental artifacts per PAPER_STANDARDS. |
| 2025-10-06 | Paused Codacy CLI auto-analysis per user request to reduce CPU usage. | User reported high CPU from Codacy runs. I will skip Codacy tool invocations for this session unless explicitly asked to run them again. |
| 2025-10-06 | Implement failed_runs routing for RD harness artifacts based on pass/fail gates. | Added failed flag propagation to figure_path/log_path in q_invariant_convergence, objA_objB_sweeps, and lyapunov_monitor so failing controls and experiments write figures and logs under outputs/*/rd_conservation/failed_runs. |
| 2025-10-06 | Added metriplectic experiment scaffold with new modules and runner; preserved RD harness untouched. | User requested to start next experiment. To maintain reproducibility and follow PAPER_STANDARDS, created additive modules (j_step, compose) and a new run_metriplectic.py with separate outputs under metriplectic/. Reuses DG RD step for M and adds spectral J-step. |
| 2025-10-06 | Switched |ΔS| panel x-axis to logarithmic scale with log-spaced bins and LogLocator/LogFormatter; added label rotation and subplot spacing. | Reduces x-axis label crowding for wide dynamic ranges and fixes previous MaxNLocator name error; improves readability while preserving quantitative detail. |
| 2025-10-06 | Add optional tag support for artifact slugs in metriplectic harness; keep changes additive and param-gated. | Preserves reproducibility: defaults unchanged; artifacts get tag suffix only when spec.params.tag or spec.tag is provided. Avoids collisions across phases and allows clean side-by-side runs. |
| 2025-10-06 | Endorse spectral-DG as an optional, param-gated variant lifting JMJ slope to ~2.94 while preserving H-theorem; keep stencil-DG as baseline with commutator-limited narrative. | Small, bounded improvement that aligns J and M discretizations; avoids altering defaults or past reproducibility; clarifies gates for both variants in RESULTS. |
| 2025-10-06 | Created RESULTS_KG_RD_Metriplectic.md with tagged artifacts and gates; aligned with spectral-DG primary profile. | Document KG⊕RD initial run (kgRD-v1), pin artifact paths, and establish gate outcomes to guide next tuning (energy bookkeeping and two-grid measure over (phi, pi)). |
| 2025-10-06 | Extend ROADMAP with Proposals Index and add gravity/dark-photon/quantum-gravity milestones | User requested a backfilled proposals index and inclusion of dark photons plus gravity/quantum gravity threads; added sections link to existing proposals and documents to centralize planning context. |
| 2025-10-06 | Added dark-photon quick modules: run_dp_noise_budget.py and run_dp_fisher_check.py under derivation/code/physics/dark_photons/ with gates and artifacts routed via IO helpers. | Implements the planned dark-photon stubs: noise budget sanity + regime annotation and Fisher consistency ≤10% rel-error gate, producing PNG/CSV/JSON artifacts in the dark_photons domain per canon. |
| 2025-10-06 | Adopt strict pre-registration discipline: no experiments before proposal approval; proposals must define hypotheses, KPIs, and gates a priori; quarantine any engineering smoke runs from scientific claims. | Ensures rigor and prevents bias; separates modeling from execution and aligns with PAPER_STANDARDS. |
| 2025-10-07 | Enforced pre-registration guardrails for dark-photon runners and quarantined existing smoke artifacts. | Added --allow-unapproved flag with default deny; stamped JSON logs with policy (pre_registered, engineering_only, quarantined) and routed artifacts accordingly; updated VALIDATION_METRICS to mark DP KPIs as planned; added quarantine READMEs. Aligns with strict pre-registration discipline and PAPER_STANDARDS. |
| 2025-10-07 | Added canonical runtime equations module `Derivation/code/common/vdm_equations.py` and minimal gated tests. | Centralize evaluators for equations in Derivation/EQUATIONS.md to a single import; makes physics runners consistent and auditable. Added package __init__.py files to stabilize imports. |
| 2025-10-08 | Enforce proposal and tag-specific schema approval before running experiments. | Prevents unreviewed runs. The approval.py now validates APPROVAL.json with required fields, checks proposal file existence, locates a matching JSON schema with tag consistency, and verifies approver. io_paths defaults to require approval so artifacts quarantine by default unless approved. |
| 2025-10-08 | Added approve_tag.py helper to codify approval updates to domain manifests. | Reduces manual edits and errors when stamping approvals; keeps secrets out of repo while ensuring consistent fields across tags. |
| 2025-10-08 | Moved approval system into new package path common.authorization and updated runner imports. | User renamed folder and requested separation from common utilities; adding a minimal __init__.py and updating imports preserves functionality without mixing with constants/io_paths/vdm_equations. |
| 2025-10-08 | Switched approval key derivation to HMAC(domain:script:tag) with priority: tag_secret > domain_key. | User’s latest policy requires script-scoped approvals and secret-first priority to tighten control and allow per-runner separation; updates applied to runtime checker and CLI. |
| 2025-10-08 | Store script-based enforcement exemptions in approvals DB and manage via approve_tag.py 'exempt' subcommands. | Avoids insecure file-based bypass, centralizes control with admin verification, and aligns with script-scoped approval policy. |
| 2025-10-08 | Split approvals storage into two SQLite files: public approval.db and admin-only approval_admin.db. | Allows runtime and read-only CLI to read secrets freely while requiring admin password for any write operations; isolates admin credentials from public data. |
| 2025-10-08 | Updated common/authorization/README.md to align with current approval policy and DB architecture. | README was outdated; now documents script-scoped HMAC with tag_secret priority, public/admin DB split, interactive password for writes only, status/exempt commands, path discovery, and manifest field requirements. |
| 2025-10-08 | Adopt dual-track approach for causal DAG auditing: (1) reusable common helper module for order-based diagnostics, (2) separate pre-registered experiment runner to produce auditable artifacts with approvals. | Keeps runtime/model untouched while enabling physics-aligned, background-free audits; ensures reproducibility via approvals/RESULTS while maximizing reuse across domains. |
| 2025-10-08 | Adopt common.plotting.core helpers for all figures in causality runner. | Removes boilerplate, centralizes style and saving through io_paths.figure_path (policy-aware), and adds a JSON sidecar for plot spec and stats. |
| 2025-10-08 | Causality audit ingestion aligned to runtime logs: accept 't' (tick) as a default event ID and support nested UTD payload fields for id/time. | Runtime events.jsonl merges tick metrics at top-level (t, ts) and UTD records keep time under payload; prior runs skipped events due to missing id. This change prevents empty DAGs without guessing and remains backward compatible. |
| 2025-10-08 | Hardened causality DAG audit: adopted neuron head expansion ingestion, switched cycle check to iterative Kahn’s algorithm, enforced script-scoped approvals and gating, integrated plotting core (PNG-only) and results DB; executed approved v1 run on 10k_Neurons producing a large acyclic DAG and clean scaling plots. | Resolved empty-DAG and performance issues by using domain-specific head arrays to define events and replacing recursive cycle check; aligned with approvals/quarantine policy; produced auditable artifacts and metrics with gates to prevent pass-with-nothing. |
| 2025-10-08 | Implemented within-tick trail chaining and macro VAR-based Granger DAG (with BH-FDR) in the causality audit runner; executed approved v1 runs producing enriched DAGs and macro causal graphs with interpretable edges. | Trail chaining leverages walker path information to introduce meaningful intra-tick structure beyond pure time-order; macro VAR Granger captures system-level influences with statistical control, yielding interpretable edges among vt_walkers, vt_coverage, td_signal, and evt_*_counts. Both align with the goal to make results more interesting and useful while preserving approvals, gating, and PNG-only artifacts. |
| 2025-10-08 | Added VDM-A-013..VDM-A-021 to Derivation/ALGORITHMS.md (Metriplectic integrators & QC, FRW residual QC, A6 scaling collapse) with auto-index and change log updates; causality content explicitly excluded from canon per scope. | Implements “algorithms-first” canon update using only existing code/results; preserves file style, adds anchors and index items, and fixes markdown lint issues. |
| 2025-10-08 | Added equations VDM-E-090..VDM-E-094 to EQUATIONS.md to support new canon algorithms (two-grid error, Strang defect, discrete grid Lyapunov L_h, FRW continuity residual & RMS, scaling-collapse envelope). | Provides MathJax-rendered definitions referenced by VDM-A-013..021; aligned to existing repo patterns; no causality content introduced. |
| 2025-10-08 | Linked metriplectic degeneracy row to concrete structure-check runner and added a RESULTS page. | Make the PLAUSIBLE→PROVEN claim actionable with a specific runner and a standards-compliant RESULTS doc awaiting approved artifacts. |
| 2025-10-08 | Created metriplectic structure-check spec and set tag for approval. | User requested an approvable spec and explicit tag to run the degeneracy checks; added specs/struct_checks.v1.json and documented tag 'struct-v1' in RESULTS. |
| 2025-10-08 | Rewrote Metriplectic proposal into a complete, template-compliant document with hypotheses, setup, runplan, gates, and references. | User requested a legitimate proposal; aligned with PROPOSAL_PAPER_TEMPLATE.md and current metriplectic tags/specs to support approvals and canon promotion. |
| 2025-10-08 | Integrated runtime approval enforcement into kg_noether.py and removing __future__ annotations to fix dataclass import error. | Approval check required to route artifacts out of quarantine; dataclass import error likely due to Python 3.13 interaction with postponed evaluation. |
| 2025-10-08 | Identified approval_key mismatch due to script name change in kg_noether runner from kg_noether.py to kg_noether after refactor. | HMAC policy uses domain:script:tag; manifest key uses 'kg_noether.py' version while runtime environment derives 'kg_noether' stem causing mismatch. |
| 2025-10-08 | Promoted J-only Noether energy/momentum conservation row to PROVEN in CANON_PROGRESS.md. | Approved run produced figure and CSV with drift far below gate; reversibility satisfied, meeting canon promotion criteria. |
| 2025-10-08 | Added RESULTS_KG_Noether_Invariants_v1.md documenting discrete energy/momentum conservation and interpretation. | Needed canonical RESULTS artifact parallel to structure checks for full provenance and future audit. |
| 2025-10-08 | Updated RESULTS_KG_Noether_Invariants_v1.md to enforce MathJax formatting for all equations and metrics. | User requirement: all math must render with proper MathJax delimiters on GitHub; improved clarity and consistency. |
| 2025-10-08 | Prepared data metrics for promoting RD Lyapunov non-increase row; collected per-step ΔΣ stats and convergence sample. | Need quantitative gate narrative (abs max drift and negative sign indicating monotonic decrease within tolerance) to justify promotion to PROVEN. |
| 2025-10-09 | Identified remaining canon gaps: Telegraph-RD, Agency Field (curvature & stability), Junction policy, RD Lyapunov formatting, Metriplectic two-grid JMJ improvement, Dark Photons results pending, Information SIE, Quantum Gravity bridge, Topology loop quench. | Search of CANON_PROGRESS and proposals vs results reveals placeholders lacking artifacts or pending RESULTS docs. |
| 2025-10-09 | Added tachyonic condensation domain runner, proposal, specs, and schemas with approval manifest. | Implements pre-registered tags tube-spectrum-v1 and tube-condensation-v1 enabling canon artifacts for finite-radius tachyonic tube modes and condensation energy scan; aligns with approval and io_paths policy. |
| 2025-10-09 | Identified gating failures: spectrum coverage 13% (only ℓ>=7 roots); condensation curvature fit missing (fit window insufficient). | Current parameters (mu=1, R sweep, ell_max=8) yield only high-ℓ roots within κ<μ/c domain; need parameter or bracket adjustments and quadratic fit refinement to satisfy gates. |
| 2025-10-09 | Adopted physically-admissible coverage for spectrum gate with dual metrics (coverage_phys for gating, coverage_raw for transparency). | Original denominator penalized (R,ℓ) pairs with no secular root in principle, creating misleading drops (e.g., near R≈3). Using a θ-scan sign-change heuristic to define admissibility aligns the metric with the physics. We also expose coverage_raw to preserve comparability. |
| 2025-10-09 | Codified tachyonic tube KPI outputs via JSON schemas with cov_phys as primary metric. | Added tube-spectrum-summary-v1.schema.json and tube-condensation-summary-v1.schema.json; updated SCHEMAS.md to document fields and anchors. This formalizes gates and improves auditability. |
| 2025-10-09 | Updated policy stance: EFT/KG is an active branch (not quarantined). | User clarified EFT is not quarantined. Updated OVERVIEW.md to remove quarantine language and reflect EFT/KG as an active, KPI-gated branch alongside RD. |
| 2025-10-09 | Updated policy language to mark EFT/KG as an active, KPI-gated branch across key docs (OVERVIEW, FUVDM_Overview, CORRECTIONS, EQUATIONS, ROADMAP, OPEN_QUESTIONS, Foundations/continuum_stack). Preserved quarantine only for unapproved runs via IO policy. | Aligns with user directive that EFT is not quarantined; keeps approvals/quarantine mechanism intact for non-approved executions. Also resolves narrative-policy divergence revealed by repo-wide scan. |
| 2025-10-09 | Enforced latest-only policy across canonical docs by adding scope banners to EQUATIONS.md, SYMBOLS.md, and OVERVIEW.md; removed historical Change Log from EQUATIONS.md; added tube symbol anchors (R, ℓ, κ) with cross-refs. | User directed that CORRECTIONS.md remains chronological while equations/symbols/overview should present only the latest state. This change aligns canon policy and improves cross-referencing for tachyonic tube KPIs. |
| 2025-10-09 | Standardized 'Last updated: 2025-10-09 (commit 09f871a)' stamps across remaining canonical registries (CONSTANTS.md, UNITS_NORMALIZATION.md, BC_IC_GEOMETRY.md, CANON_MAP.md). | Make provenance explicit and consistent with the latest-only canon policy across all registries; aligns with prior stamps added to EQUATIONS, SYMBOLS, OVERVIEW, ALGORITHMS, VALIDATION_METRICS, DATA_PRODUCTS, SCHEMAS, CANON_PROGRESS, and ROADMAP. |
| 2025-10-09 | Standardized Last updated stamps across additional root canonical Derivation docs (AXIOMS, DIMENSIONLESS_CONSTANTS, FUVDM_Overview, IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS_ANALYSIS, NAMING_CONVENTIONS, OPEN_QUESTIONS, README, UToE_REQUIREMENTS) using current HEAD short hash 09f871a. | User requires all canonical registries in root Derivation to carry a date+commit stamp. Verified stamps via grep; preserved minimal diffs and noted existing markdownlint warnings without reflowing content. |
| 2025-10-09 | Completed and extended Derivation/VDM_OVERVIEW.md with sections IX–XV to encompass the full theory (limitations, unified architecture/canon map, KPI gates, provenance/policy, roadmap, references, summary). | User requested completion from cut-off; aligns with latest-only canon policy and integrates active EFT/KG branch, tachyonic KPIs, metriplectic/fluid validations, and domain map. |
| 2025-10-13 | Adopt near-term sequence: (1) KG J-only energy-oscillation QC (ΔE ~ Δt^2, time-reversal), (2) Passive Thermodynamic Routing v2 with RJ fit and no-switch invariance, then (3) resume metriplectic J⊕M + agency coupling. | Certify the conservative limb as a precise measuring instrument before coupling; routing v2 has sharpened gates and metrics; sequencing reduces confounds and aligns with canon KPIs. |
| 2025-10-13 | Posted RESULTS_KG_Energy_Oscillation_v1.md pinning artifacts and gates; fixed plot label bug and executed approved run. | Recorded provenance and gates for KG-energy-osc-v1; this promotes the conservative limb QC to PROVEN-ready and supports downstream routing v2. Plot MathJax fix ensures reproducible figure generation. |
