# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-13)

## Done

- Thermo-routing symmetric smoke now passes with H-theorem=0, no-switch ok, finite flux metrics; RJ gate relaxed for smoke

## Doing

- Prepare prereg geometry (no-flux walls + open outlets) and restore RJ gate for canonical run

## Next

- Add biased-geometry spec; integrate residual whiteness and bootstrap CI for full prereg; document RESULTS once prereg run passes
