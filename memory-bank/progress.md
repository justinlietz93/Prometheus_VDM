# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-06)

## Done

- Created rd_conservation harness with controls and step_spec snapshot logging; fixed Codacy lint warnings.

## Doing

- Wire dt-sweep and Obj-A/B residuals with periodic BC and adjacency fidelity; add CONTRADICTION_REPORT logic.

## Next

- Integrate CAS attempt (symbolic Q/H forms), discrete Lyapunov computation (Obj-C), and V5 out-of-sample re-run with frozen params.
