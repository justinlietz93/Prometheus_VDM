# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-29)

## Done

- Tier 1 preflight metriplectic tests executed (Derivation-only): J-only reversibility PASS; Energy-oscillation slope via dedicated runner p≈2, R²≥0.999 PASS; A4 degeneracies J-skew/M-PSD PASS; Strang defect slope in [2.8,3.2] PASS.
- Added M-only H-theorem monotonicity test (Lyapunov L_h non-increase) — PASS.

## Doing

- Preparing to log decisions and link results to VALIDATION_METRICS.md anchors.

## Next

- Run CEG test under strict gates in Tier 1; prepare results artifacts (1 figure, 1 CSV, 1 JSON) and approvals routing via io_paths.
