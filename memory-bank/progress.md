# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-08)

## Done

- Added approve_tag.py CLI to automate manifest approval updates (approved_by/at, approval_key, allowed_tags).
- Updated common/README.md with cleaned instructions and examples for approval workflow and generator usage.

## Doing

- Ready to run approve_tag.py for specific tags once you confirm the approver and secret/key setup.

## Next

- Optionally integrate unit tests for approval.py and approve_tag.py.
- Mark approved tags in metriplectic APPROVAL.json using the new tool.
