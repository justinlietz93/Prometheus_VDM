## Done

- Upgraded PROPOSAL_Physics_Native_Intelligence_v1.md to whitepaper-grade with explicit gates, MathJax, and provenance
- Created im-substrate-v1 JSON schema and linked it in domain APPROVAL.json
- Added non-executable spec stub for review (no runner added)

## Doing

- Awaiting tag approval for im-substrate-v1; prepare RESULTS skeleton only after approved runs
