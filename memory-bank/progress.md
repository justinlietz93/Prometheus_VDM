# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-09)

## Done

- Enforced latest-only canon policy in EQUATIONS.md, SYMBOLS.md, and OVERVIEW.md; removed EQUATIONS.md historical Change Log; added tube symbol anchors (R, ℓ, κ) with cross-references.

## Doing

- Optional follow-up: light markdown lint pass across SYMBOLS.md tables and EQUATIONS.md anchors; sweep other canon docs for a small latest-only banner if desired.

## Next

- Add JSON schema validation to tube runners on summary write; add SYMBOLS.md anchor links from KPI docs (VALIDATION_METRICS.md) if needed.
