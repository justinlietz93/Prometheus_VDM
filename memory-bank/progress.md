# Progress (Updated: 2025-10-06)

## Done

- Implemented H_energy two-grid norm and ran kgRD-v1b; artifacts pinned
- Added KG Noether checks (energy/momentum) and dispersion module; ran and logged results
- Introduced metriplectic structure checks; verified skew(J) and PSD(M)

## Doing

- Summarizing gates and pinned paths; integrating short RESULTS snippet

## Next

- Optionally refine J-only energy oscillation diagnostic to multi-step amplitude; otherwise freeze Obj-B as EXPLAINED-BY-DEFECT per gate
