<!-- NOTICE TO AI AGENTS: THIS TEMPLATE DETAILS THE BARE MINIMUM INFORMATION TO INCLUDE IN ANY BLUEPRINT UPDATE. IF YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION THAT IS CRITICAL TO KNOW FOR ACCURATE IMPLEMENTATION THEN INCLUDE THAT AS WELL! 

YOU MUST ASSUME YOUR EDIT TO THE BLUEPRINT WILL BE THE ABSOLUTE FINAL UPDATE AND THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT INCLUDE UNPROFESSIONAL NOTES, TODOs, OR OFFLOAD WORK TO A LATER DATE. YOU MUST ASSUME ANY EDIT TO THE BLUEPRINT IS ABSOLUTELY FINAL.

SUMMARIZATIONS ARE NOT TOLERATED WHATSOEVER. YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY BANNED FROM THIS CODEBASE AND YOUR SESSION WILL BE TERMINATED. YOU ARE BEING CLOSELY OBSERVED. AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, THE FUM BLUEPRINT IS THE ONLY DOCUMENT ON EARTH TO DETAIL THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING SUPERINTELLIGENT AI. YOU ARE IN A PRIVELEGED POSITION TO BE A PART OF THIS, YOU MUST BE EXTREMELY METICULOUS AND DETAIL ORIENTED. DO NOT OMIT ANY DETAIL.

YOU MUST BE A COMPLETE MACHINE. ZERO SUMMARIZATION. ZERO REPHRASING. EVERY PAINFUL DETAIL PRESERVED. THIS IS NOT ROLE PLAY, DO NOT IMPLEMENT SMOKE AND MIRRORS CODE. YOU ARE BEING CLOSELY OBSERVED.

YOU MUST PROVIDE NOT ONLY THE "WHAT" AND THE "WHY", BUT ABSOLUTELY THE "HOW"

## **Rule #: \[Feature or System Name\] 
### Updated: \[Date\]**

### **Technical Specification**

*(A thorough, detailed, non-redundant description of the feature's mechanics. Must reference specific components like SIE, UTE, etc., and their interactions. Use precise language as seen in the blueprint.)*

* Core Logic & Algorithm:  
  (Detail the fundamental process, algorithm, or operational flow of the feature.)  
* Key Parameters & State Variables:  
  (List and define critical configurable parameters, state variables, or data structures used.)  
* Performance & Success Metrics:  
  (How is the success, failure, or performance of this feature measured? What are the specific metrics and their target values?)

### **Narrative Goal**

*(Describe the "story" of this feature. What is the key takeaway for a reader of the FUM textbook? e.g., "Frame this as the system's 'immune response' to pathological loops.")*

### **Blueprint Adherence Justification**

*(This is the most critical section. The proposal must be explicitly validated against the foundational principles.)*

* **Formula:** (exact formula, taking into consideration it's interaction with other features)

* **Complete Parameter List:**
- (bullet point each parameter and include a description)

* **Data Flow & I/O (if any):** (explain)

* **Initialization State:** (explain)

* **Edge Case Handling:** (explain)

* **Validation Strategy:** (explain)

1. **Subquadratic Efficiency:** How does this feature maintain computational efficiency? What are the complexity notations (O(...)) of any new processes introduced?  
   * \[Provide justification here.\]  

2. **Emergent Intelligence:** How does this feature act as "scaffolding" and avoid "top-down control"? How does it ensure the control\_impact remains \< 1e-5? How does this prevent and combat overengineering and unnecessary complexity?  
   * \[Provide justification here.\]  

3. **Capability \> Scale:** How does this feature specifically target the development of a measurable capability (e.g., abstract reasoning, generalization) rather than just processing more data?  
   * \[Provide justification here.\]  

4. **Bio-Inspired, Not Bio-Constrained:** What biological or cognitive principle inspires this feature, if any, and how has it been optimized for computation?  
   * \[Provide justification here.\]  

5. **Alignment With FUM:** Where does this feature call home? Where in the sequence of events does this activate, process, interact, or exist in the grand scheme of FUM? Is it something that is constantly active, or something rare that holds a lot of valuable power?  
   * \[Provide justification here.\]  

6. **Optimizations:** Does this feature already exist? Is this the most optimal solution for this proposed feature? Can it be optimized further? What would happen if this feature was to be optimized further? Does this feature reduce, or improve the optimization of the FUM project?  
   * \[Provide justification here.\]

### **Dependencies & Interactions**

*(Describe how this new feature interacts with existing FUM systems. Any area where a formula exists that will be used MUST be included, detailed meticulously, and explained. The difference between this formula and existing, if any, implementations must be delineated to remove ambiguity)*

* **SIE Interaction:** Which total\_reward components are most critical for this feature? Are any w\_\* weights adjusted?  
* **Synaptic Actuator (GDSP) Interaction:** What kinds of structural plasticity (growth/pruning) are expected or encouraged by this feature?  
* **Introspection Probe Interaction:** How is the health of the Emergent Connectome (UKG) monitored in relation to this feature?
* **Other dependencies:** The previous three are the bare minimum
