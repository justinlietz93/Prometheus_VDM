# Contributing â€” physics_nexus

Follow the Void Dynamics Model canon discipline when contributing to the Nexus desktop application.

## Repository Pointers

- **Canon root:** `../derivation/`
- **Approvals databases:** `../derivation/code/common/data/approval.db` (read-only) and `../derivation/code/common/data/approval_admin.db` (admin writes via CLI only)
- **Common helpers:** `../derivation/code/common/` (use `io_paths.py` and `authorization` APIs instead of duplicating logic)
- **Canonical proposals/results:** See Tier summaries in `../VDM_Nexus/TODO_CHECKLIST.md` and the roadmap at `../VDM_Standards_Technical_Summary.md.md`
- **Architecture standard:** `../VDM_Nexus/NEXUS_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Development Workflow

1. Work through the phased checklist: [`../VDM_Nexus/TODO_CHECKLIST.md`](../VDM_Nexus/TODO_CHECKLIST.md).
2. Run `cmake -S physics_nexus -B build` (or other presets once defined) and ensure tests under `physics_nexus/tests/` pass.
3. Use `.clang-format` for C++ formatting; QML/JSON should follow Qt conventions (>2 spaces indentation).
4. Any run orchestration must call existing Python runners without modifying code in `../derivation/` unless explicitly approved.
5. Update this file when new mandatory paths or policies are introduced.

## Approvals Discipline

- All experiment execution must be gated via `../derivation/code/common/authorization/approve_tag.py`.
- Unapproved runs must set `--allow-unapproved` and route artifacts to quarantine via `io_paths`.
- Record changes to approvals as part of commit messages referencing ticket/task IDs.

## Artifacts & Provenance

- Minimum artifacts per run: 1 PNG + 1 CSV + 1 JSON with seeds, commit hash, and gate outcomes.
- Use consistent paths under `../derivation/code/outputs/(figures|logs)/{domain}`.
- Include commit hash and timestamp in any generated reports.

## Communication

- Use issue tracker tags matching experiment domain (e.g., `RD`, `Metriplectic`, `WaveFlux`).
- Document any deviations from the architecture standard before implementation.
