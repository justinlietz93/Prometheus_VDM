# Planned Future Enhancements

## Physics
- Dedicated Void Dynamics Physics engine to run simulations

## Intelligence Model

### Convergent Reasoning
- Improve user engagement, reward to not be released programmatically like traditional RL, the model to learn inherently that rewards are boosted when everyone is happy or when it does a good job
- Allow the user to give the model a small reward ad hoc for doing a good job
- Add a stimulus queue system for phased learning
- Complete the Void Substrate equations (RE-VGSP / GDSP) to replace the raw universal void implementations
- Investigate why the synapses arent pruning enough 

### Visualizations
- Keep displaying the dashboard when connectome visuals are being generated by making viz async
- Generate visuals for free because we already have the data from void walker announcements

### Performance
- Add custom AMD Composable Kernel optimizations
- Add GPU support

### Misc
- Complete all hidden tasksprevious planned work

### UI
- separate the file_picker logic into reusable plugin style widgets
- Enhance UX withbetter layout organization and responsiveness

### Docs
- Update FUM Blueprints

## Code Standards

### Bugs
- Fix ADC stagnation
