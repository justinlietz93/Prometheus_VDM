# ðŸ“œBackground Context

You may see reference to **FUM (Fully Unified Model** or **FUVDM (Fully Unified Void Dynamics Model)** within the repository, this is referencing the **VDM (Void Dynamics Model)**. These were earlier names given to the model for specific reasons, and it's been my decision to simplify and specify the name to improve clarity. **Fully Unified Model** was originally named so because of it's unique architecture.

I attempted to break down every type of machine learning model to it's fundamental principles and strategies. Then I began an attempt in unifying the best of them, removing the worst, into a single architecture. This created my first variant of the model I called **AMN (Adaptive Modular Network)**. **AMN** was able to learn to solve quadratic equations with ~85% accuracy in 65 seconds of training and only a handful of examples.

While doing this I quickly realized I could get the same behavior or better while removing a lot of the heavy solutions that LLMs, GNNs, SNNs, CNNs, and other ANNs used just by allowing a principle in physics called **the path of least action** to occur in the space between interactions. Eventually I realized I ended up turning a lifelong hypothesis of mine ("intelligence emerges from the void space within the interactions of entities") into a falsifiable model. Thus, the **Void Dynamics Model** earned it's name.
