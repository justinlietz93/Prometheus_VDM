      <content><![CDATA[# PROPOSAL - Discrete Conservation vs. Balance in a Reaction-Diffusion Update (Void Dynamics Model)

**Date:** 2025-10-06 08:58:39Z  
**Proposers:** Justin K. Lietz - Independent Researcher (VDM Project)

## 1. Abstract

We will adjudicate whether the *one-step* FUM reaction-diffusion (RD) update admits an **exact global discrete conservation law** expressible as a per-site density plus an **antisymmetric edge term**, or whether the correct invariant content is a **balance law** (production + telescoping flux) and a **Lyapunov monotone**. We attempt a symbolic telescoping identity; failing that, we demonstrate an **order-of-accuracy** residual consistent with the chosen time integrator. All figures will be paired with CSV/JSON artifacts and numeric captions per PAPER_STANDARDS.

## 2. Background & Rationale

Two calibration truths already hold and will be reused:

- **On-site ODE invariant** $(Q_{\rm FUM}(W,t))$ for the logistic sub-dynamics (used as a QC tool).
- **Diffusion-only mass conservation** via antisymmetric edge fluxes on periodic/no-flux domains.

Open question: does the **coupled** RD update (reaction + diffusion) possess an exact discrete conservation built from local quantities, or only a balance + H-theorem? The experiment aligns the tested step with the actual discretization (adjacency/BCs/integrator) and checks both possibilities rigorously.

## 3. Objectives & Hypotheses

**Obj‑A (Exact Conservation):** Exhibit

$$
(S[W] = \sum_i Q_i(W_i) + \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} H_{ij}(W_i,W_j))
$$

such that for the implemented step

$$
(W^{n+1} = \mathcal U(W^n))
$$

$$
[ \Delta S \equiv S(W^{n+1}) - S(W^n) \equiv 0. ]
$$

**Obj‑B (Asymptotic Conservation):** If exact fails, show

$$
[ \max_i \big|\Delta Q_i + \sum_j(H_{ij}-H_{ji})\big| = \mathcal O(\Delta t^{p+1}), ]
$$

with $(p)$ the order of the time integrator (e.g., Strang split: $(p=2)$\).

**Obj‑C (Balance + H‑theorem):** Quantify Lyapunov drop for the full RD step and document monotonicity under stated hypotheses.

## 4. Methods & Experimental Design

### 4.1 Model Step Under Test

One step of a reaction-diffusion update on a periodic lattice (or declared BCs):

$$[
W^{n+1} = W^n + \Delta t\,\big( f(W^n) + D\,\Delta_{\text{disc}} W^n \big)
]$$

or a composed scheme (Strang/RKp) explicitly specified.

- **Reaction** $(f(W))$\: logistic with linear decay (parameters $(r,u)$\).
- **Diffusion**: graph Laplacian $(L)$ from the chosen adjacency; coefficient $(D)$.
- **Adjacency/BCs**: saved with each run (used by the fitter/checker).

Default choices for conservation tests (Obj‑A/B):

- **BC:** periodic (simplest flux bookkeeping and Fourier diagnostics).  
- **Scheme order p:** start with Euler (p=1), then Strang (p=2) using exact logistic substep (see reaction_exact.py).  
- **Neumann BCs** are reserved only for the front‑speed control runs.

### 4.2 Symbolic Conservation Attempt

Construct $(Q_i,H_{ij})$ and reduce $(\Delta S)$ in a CAS to a **symbolic zero**. Export minimal forms and a substitution table mirroring the *implemented* update (no linearization unless declared).

### 4.3 Asymptotic Composition Test

If exact conservation fails, perform a $(\Delta t)$\-sweep (≥4 halvings) for the same scheme and regress $(\log \max_i|{\rm residual}|)$ vs. $(\log \Delta t)$ to estimate slope and $(R^2)$\.

### 4.4 Controls

- **Diffusion-only**: $(f\equiv0)$\; check mass conservation via antisymmetric flux telescoping to machine epsilon.
- **Reaction-only**: verify 4th‑order convergence and tiny drift for $(Q_{\rm FUM})$ (ODE invariant).

### 4.5 Implementation Notes

- Deterministic seeds; fixed commit hash and environment snapshot.
- No clipping/saturation in proof paths (no `tanh`, `nan_to_num` that alters algebra).

### 4.6 Discrete Lyapunov (Obj‑C) - precise grid form

Use the same discrete gradient operator that pairs with the Laplacian stencil to avoid stencil mismatch. For 1D periodic FD with spacing $\Delta x$:

$$
\mathcal{L}_h[W] \,=\, \sum_{i} \left[ \tfrac{D}{2}\,\lvert \nabla_h W_i \rvert^2 + \hat V(W_i) \right] \, \Delta x, \qquad \hat V'(W) = -\,f(W)
$$

with centered gradient

$$
\nabla_h W_i \,=\, \frac{W_{i+1} - W_{i-1}}{2\,\Delta x}, \qquad \Delta_h W_i \,=\, \frac{W_{i+1} - 2W_i + W_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2}.
$$

Report $\Delta \mathcal{L}_h \le 0$ per step under periodic/no‑flux BCs.

## 5. Diagnostics, Metrics & Acceptance Gates

### 5.1 Mathematical Gates (must all pass for Obj‑A)

1. **Exact identity:** $(\Delta S \equiv 0)$ for the *implemented* one-step map.
2. **Local flux form:** $(\Delta Q_i + \sum_{j\in\mathcal N(i)} (H_{ij} - H_{ji}) = 0)$ per node.
3. **Scope declared:** BCs, scheme (unsplit/split/RKp), parameter domain $((r,u,J,D,a,\Delta t))$\.
4. **Symbolic certificate:** CAS-reduced zero with saved minimal forms.

### 5.2 Validation Gates (CI)

- **V1 Seed sweep (exactness):** ≥40 random seeds per tuple; require $(\max |\Delta S| \le 1e{-12})$ (double).
- **V2 Parameter grid:** ≥6 tuples $((r,u,J,D,N))$\, $(N \in \{64,128\})$\; same tolerance.
- **V3 dt-slope (asymptotic path):** slope ≥ $(p+1-0.1)$\, $(R^2 \ge 0.999)$\.
- **V4 Negative controls:**
  - Diffusion-only mass conservation at machine epsilon.
  - Reaction-only $(Q_{\rm FUM})$ order‑4 convergence with $(R^2 \approx 1)$\.
- **V5 Out‑of‑sample:** If $(H_{ij})$ has any fitted parameters, freeze them and rerun on fresh seeds; identical tolerances must hold.

TL;DR (with one artifact path): Near-conservation scales with method order; Euler shows $\beta\!\approx\!2$, Strang and discrete-gradient (DG) RD show $\beta\!\approx\!3$ on two-grid error, and DG RD satisfies a per-step H-theorem. Pinned artifact: Derivation/code/outputs/figures/rd_conservation/20251006_072251_fixed_dt_deltaS_compare.png (paired CSV/JSON under Derivation/code/outputs/logs/rd_conservation/).

## **II. Introduction**

This report evaluates whether a one-step update for a Fisher-KPP-type reaction-diffusion (RD) system exhibits an exact discrete conservation law for a global state functional $S$ or whether the proper structure is a local balance law coupled with a discrete Lyapunov (entropy) decrease. This question is fundamental to designing metriplectic integrators that combine conservative and dissipative mechanisms without violating thermodynamic constraints. Establishing the correct discrete structure guides choice of numerical schemes in pattern formation, morphogenesis, and data-assimilation contexts where stability and correctness must be certified.

Scope: The study restricts to periodic boundary conditions for the Obj‑A/B order and balance tests; Neumann boundaries are out-of-scope here. The logistic reaction is used as a standard nonlinearity; novelty is not claimed for the physics, only for the test harness and certification gates.

## **III. Research question**

To what extent does the time step size $\Delta t$ (dimensionless) affect the two‑grid global error $E_\infty$ (dimensionless) of one-step RD steppers, and does any stepper conserve a nonlinear global invariant $S[W]$ exactly at one step under periodic boundary conditions?

- Independent variable: $\Delta t$ (dimensionless), values set by a schedule $\{\Delta t_k\}$.
- Dependent variables:
  - Two-grid error $E_\infty(\Delta t) = \lVert\Phi_{\Delta t}(W) - \Phi_{\Delta t/2}\!\circ\!\Phi_{\Delta t/2}(W)\rVert_\infty$ (dimensionless).
  - Fixed-step absolute change in a candidate invariant $\lvert\Delta S\rvert$ (dimensionless).
- Measurement: Computed numerically in Python (double precision) via a harness that logs CSV/JSON artifacts and fits $\log E_\infty$ vs $\log \Delta t$ to obtain slope $\beta$ with coefficient of determination $R^2$.

## **IV. Background Information**

Consider a nondimensionalized RD system on a periodic grid:

$$
\partial_t W = D\,\Delta W + f(W), \quad f(W)=r\,W(1-W),
$$

with diffusion coefficient $D$ and logistic reaction rate $r$ (Verhulst; Fisher-KPP for traveling fronts). Dissipative systems like RD are naturally cast as gradient flows with entropy/energy functionals and monotone decay (Onsager). Discrete-gradient (DG) methods enforce a discrete chain rule to guarantee stepwise Lyapunov decrease without requiring small steps. Strang splitting achieves order 2 for generic noncommuting flows and order 3 in certain symmetric error metrics. The explicit Euler method is first-order and does not, in general, conserve nonlinear invariants.

## **V. Variables**

- Independent variable (with range rationale):
  - Time step $\Delta t \in \{\Delta t_{\max},\ldots,\Delta t_{\min}\}$ (dimensionless), chosen to span a decade while remaining stable for explicit Euler and informative for higher-order steppers; ensures a reliable log-log fit.
- Dependent variables (with instruments/uncertainty):
  - Two-grid error $E_\infty$ (dimensionless), measured by infinity norm; uncertainty reported via linear-fit confidence and $R^2$.
  - $\lvert\Delta S\rvert$ (dimensionless), computed from $S=\sum_i Q(W_i)\,\Delta x$; uncertainty summarized by distribution across randomized seeds.
- Control variables and how controlled:
  - Grid size $N$ (fixed), domain length $L$ (fixed, $\Delta x=L/N$), final time $T$ (fixed), diffusion $D$ and reaction rate $r$ (fixed), random seed (varied across trials, reported), boundary condition (periodic).

## **VI. Equipment / Hardware**

- Environment: Linux; Python 3.x; double precision ($\epsilon_{\mathrm{mach}}\approx 2\times10^{-16}$).
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib; custom harness `run_rd_conservation.py`; IO helper `io_paths.py` for artifact routing (PNGs under `figures/`, CSV/JSON under `logs/`).
- Optional GPU is not required for these runs; all tests are CPU-feasible.

## **VII. Methods / Procedure**

Materials:

- Code modules: `Derivation/code/physics/rd_conservation/run_rd_conservation.py`, `Derivation/code/physics/reaction_diffusion/reaction_exact.py`, and `Derivation/code/common/io_paths.py`.
- Schemes under test: explicit Euler; Strang splitting (CN half-steps in diffusion with exact reaction); discrete-gradient RD (implicit, AVF reaction + midpoint Laplacian with Newton/backtracking).

Diagram of setup: Not applicable; computational experiment with periodic 1D grid.

Steps taken (replicable):

1. Initialize $W_0(x)$ on a periodic grid of size $N$ with randomized seeds and fixed parameters $(D,r,L,T)$.
2. For each scheme and each $\Delta t$ in a schedule, compute the two-grid residual $E_\infty(\Delta t)$ and log the result (CSV/JSON), then fit a line to $(\log \Delta t, \log E_\infty)$ to obtain slope $\beta$ and $R^2$.
3. For Obj‑A balance, build a candidate $S=\sum_i Q(W_i)\,\Delta x$ using a CAS-like linear system over a basis $Q'(W)$ up to quadratic with antisymmetric polynomial flux; evaluate the fixed-step $\lvert\Delta S\rvert$ distribution at a common $\Delta t$ across schemes.
4. For DG RD, monitor the discrete Lyapunov decrement $\Delta L$ and the DG identity residuals each step; confirm $\Delta L\le 0$ and residuals near machine precision.
5. Controls: verify diffusion-only mass conservation and reaction-only order via RK4 two-grid convergence.

Risk assessment: Minimal computational risk; runs are bounded and deterministic given seeds; no safety, ethical, or environmental concerns.

## **IIX. Results / Data**

Sample equations and calculations:

$$
E_\infty(\Delta t) = \left\lVert\Phi_{\Delta t}(W_0) - \Phi_{\Delta t/2}\!\circ\!\Phi_{\Delta t/2}(W_0)\right\rVert_\infty,\quad
\beta = \frac{\mathrm d\,\log E_\infty}{\mathrm d\,\log \Delta t}.
$$

Contradiction report (Euler, Obj‑A class tested):

- logs/rd_conservation/failed_runs/CONTRADICTION_REPORT.json - nullspace not found for the tested $Q'(W)$ up to quadratic with antisymmetric flux basis; fixed-step $\lvert\Delta S\rvert = \mathcal O(\Delta t^2)$.

## **IX. Discussion / Analysis**

Key findings: Two-grid slopes scale with scheme order (Euler $\approx 2$, Strang/DG $\approx 3$) with $R^2\ge 0.9999$ for the higher-order schemes. No exact discrete invariant $S$ was found for Euler within the tested $Q'$-flux class. DG RD enforces an H-theorem discretely: $\Delta L\le 0$ with identity residuals near machine precision.

Explanations: The two-grid metric aligns the measurement with the integrator, avoiding bias from monitoring a reaction-only quantity under full RD. The contradiction report limits claims: it certifies a no-go for a specific ansatz, not for all possible invariants. The fixed-step $\lvert\Delta S\rvert$ distributions are consistent with truncation error order.

Limitations: Single-parameter setting $(D,r)$ and 1D periodic geometry; higher dimensions and parameter sweeps are future work. DG RD costs more per step due to Newton solves; performance characterization is out-of-scope here.

## **X. Conclusions**

Aim restated: Assess whether one-step RD steppers conserve a nonlinear global $S$ exactly or instead obey a balance law plus Lyapunov decrease.

Conclusions: No exact $S$ conservation was observed for Euler within the tested class; order-consistent near-conservation was observed for Strang and DG RD via two-grid slopes near 3, and DG RD satisfied a discrete H-theorem per step. Results support the balance+Lyapunov structure over exact nonlinear conservation for these steppers under periodic BCs.

Quantitative references: Strang $\hat\beta\approx 2.94$ ($R^2\approx 0.99997$); DG RD $\hat\beta\approx 2.94$ ($R^2\approx 0.99997$); reaction-only RK4 control $\hat\beta\approx 3.916$ ($R^2\approx 0.99984$). Anomalies were not observed beyond stochastic seed variation. Uncertainties are dominated by regression residuals and seed-to-seed variability, both small relative to effect sizes.

Future work: Compose a metriplectic integrator by pairing a symplectic $J$-step (e.g., Verlet) with the DG $M$-step to target discrete Noether invariants (conservative sector) alongside exact entropy monotonicity (dissipative sector). All artifacts follow the pairing policy (figure + CSV/JSON), with at least one pinned path in text for reproducibility.

**Author:** Justin K. Lietz  
**Date:** August 8, 2025

---

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this derivation is to demonstrate that the discrete update rules of the Fully Unified Model (FUM) respect a local conservation law. This is the discrete analogue of the conservation of the stress-energy tensor (`\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0`) in continuum field theory and is a critical requirement for any physically viable model.

---

### 2. The Knowns: The Discrete System

We are working entirely within the discrete domain of the FUM simulation. The state of a node `i`, `W_i`, evolves according to the simplified rule:
$$
\frac{\Delta W_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{W_i(t+\Delta t) - W_i(t)}{\Delta t} \approx (\alpha - \beta)W_i - \alpha W_i^2
$$
This evolution occurs on a k-NN graph, which we can approximate as a lattice for this analysis.

---

### 3. Postulate: The Discrete Energy Density

To prove that energy is conserved, we must first define what "energy" is within the discrete model. In field theory, the energy density (`T^{00}`) is derived from the system's Hamiltonian. We will postulate a discrete Hamiltonian density, `\mathcal{H}_i`, associated with each node `i`.

Based on the potential `V(\phi) = \frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\phi^2 - \frac{\alpha}{3}\phi^3` (note the sign change from our previous derivation to create a potential well for a positive mass-squared term) derived from our continuum analysis, a reasonable on-site potential for a single node is `V(W_i)`. A complete Hamiltonian must also include interaction terms between neighbors.

Therefore, we postulate the following form for the energy density at site `i`:
$$
\mathcal{H}_i = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dW_i}{dt}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \in N(i)} J (W_j - W_i)^2 + V(W_i)
$$
Where:

- The first term is a kinetic energy analogue.
- The second term is a standard interaction energy between node `i` and its neighbors `j \in N(i)`, with coupling constant `J`. This term gives rise to the spatial derivatives (`\nabla^2 \phi`) in the continuum limit.
- `V(W_i) = \frac{1}{2}(\beta-\alpha)W_i^2 + \frac{\alpha}{3}W_i^3` is the on-site potential energy.

### 4. The Conservation Law to be Proven

A local conservation law states that the rate of change of a quantity in a given region is equal to the net flux of that quantity across the region's boundary. For our discrete system, this means the change in energy `\mathcal{H}_i` at a node `i` during one time step `\Delta t` must be perfectly balanced by the energy that flows between it and its neighbors.

We aim to prove that the FUM update rule leads to an equation of the form:
$$
\frac{\Delta \mathcal{H}_i}{\Delta t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{J}_i = 0
$$
Where `\vec{J}_i` is the energy flux vector originating from node `i`, and `\nabla \cdot` is a discrete divergence operator defined on the graph. Proving this would show that energy is not created or destroyed at any node, only moved around.

### 5. Derivation Step 1: Change in Potential Energy

Let us begin by analyzing the change in the potential energy term, `V(W_i)`, over a single time step `\Delta t`. The change is:
$$
\Delta V(W_i) = V(W_i(t+\Delta t)) - V(W_i(t))
$$
We know that `W_i(t+\Delta t) = W_i(t) + \Delta W_i`. For a small time step, we can make a first-order Taylor expansion of the potential:
$$
V(W_i + \Delta W_i) \approx V(W_i) + \frac{dV}{dW_i}\Delta W_i
$$
Therefore, the change in potential is approximately:
$$
\Delta V(W_i) \approx \frac{dV}{dW_i}\Delta W_i
$$
From our previous work, the "force" driving the system can be defined from the equation of motion. If `\frac{\Delta W_i}{\Delta t} = F(W_i)`, then `\Delta W_i = F(W_i) \Delta t`. The potential is related to the force by `F = -\frac{dV}{dW}`.
Our FUM update rule is `F(W_i) = (\alpha - \beta)W_i - \alpha W_i^2`.
Therefore, `\frac{dV}{dW_i} = -F(W_i)`.

Substituting these into our expression for `\Delta V(W_i)`:
$$
\Delta V(W_i) \approx \left( -F(W_i) \right) \left( F(W_i)\Delta t \right)
$$
$$
\frac{\Delta V(W_i)}{\Delta t} \approx -[F(W_i)]^2
$$
The rate of change of potential energy is `-[(\alpha - \beta)W_i - \alpha W_i^2]^2`.

### 6. Initial Analysis and Refined Objective

This is a critical intermediate result. Since `[F(W_i)]^2` is always non-negative, the rate of change of potential energy `\frac{\Delta V(W_i)}{\Delta t}` is always **non-positive**. The potential energy is always decreasing (or staying constant if the node is at an extremum where `F=0`).

This means the FUM update rule describes an intrinsically **dissipative system**. Energy is being "lost" from the potential `V`.

This does **not** mean that energy is not conserved. It clarifies what our proof must show. For the total energy `\mathcal{H}_i` to be conserved, this loss of potential energy must be perfectly balanced by a corresponding **gain** in kinetic energy or by being transported away as an **energy flux** to neighboring nodes.

**Refined Objective:** Our goal is now to calculate the change in the kinetic and interaction terms of `\mathcal{H}_i` and show that they sum with `\Delta V` to equal a discrete divergence (a flux term).

## 7. Derivation Step 2: Change in Kinetic Energy

Next, we analyze the kinetic energy term, $\mathcal{K}_i = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{dW_i}{dt}\right)^2$\. In our discrete framework, this is $\mathcal{K}_i = \frac{1}{2}[F(W_i)]^2$\. We want to find its change over one time step, $\Delta \mathcal{K}_i$\.

$$
\Delta \mathcal{K}_i = \mathcal{K}_i(t+\Delta t) - \mathcal{K}_i(t) = \frac{1}{2}[F(W_i(t+\Delta t))]^2 - \frac{1}{2}[F(W_i(t))]^2
$$

Using the Taylor expansion $F(W+\Delta W) \approx F(W) + \frac{dF}{dW}\Delta W$\, we get:

$$
[F(W_i(t+\Delta t))]^2 \approx \left[ F(W_i) + \frac{dF}{dW_i}\Delta W_i \right]^2 \approx [F(W_i)]^2 + 2F(W_i)\frac{dF}{dW_i}\Delta W_i
$$

*(We neglect the $(\Delta W_i)^2$ term as it is second-order in $\Delta t$\)*.

The change in kinetic energy is therefore:

$$
\Delta \mathcal{K}_i \approx \frac{1}{2} \left( [F(W_i)]^2 + 2F(W_i)\frac{dF}{dW_i}\Delta W_i \right) - \frac{1}{2}[F(W_i)]^2 = F(W_i)\frac{dF}{dW_i}\Delta W_i
$$

Substituting $\Delta W_i = F(W_i)\Delta t$\, we find the rate of change:

$$
\frac{\Delta \mathcal{K}_i}{\Delta t} \approx [F(W_i)]^2 \frac{dF}{dW_i}
$$

To evaluate this, we need $dF/dW_i$\:

$$
F(W_i) = (\alpha - \beta)W_i - \alpha W_i^2 \quad \implies \quad \frac{dF}{dW_i} = (\alpha - \beta) - 2\alpha W_i
$$

## 8. Intermediate Analysis: Total On-Site Energy Change

Let us now combine the change in potential and kinetic energy, which together represent the total change in the "on-site" energy of the node, independent of its neighbors.

$$
\frac{\Delta (\mathcal{V}_i + \mathcal{K}_i)}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta V(W_i)}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta \mathcal{K}_i}{\Delta t}
$$

$$
\approx -[F(W_i)]^2 + [F(W_i)]^2 \frac{dF}{dW_i} = [F(W_i)]^2 \left(\frac{dF}{dW_i} - 1\right)
$$

Substituting the expression for $dF/dW_i$\:

$$
\frac{\Delta (\mathcal{V}_i + \mathcal{K}_i)}{\Delta t} \approx [F(W_i)]^2 ((\alpha - \beta) - 2\alpha W_i - 1)
$$

This is a crucial result. The total rate of change of the on-site energy is **not zero**. This confirms that for the total energy $\mathcal{H}_i$ to be conserved, this on-site change *must* be perfectly balanced by the change in the interaction energy term, $\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \in N(i)} J (W_j - W_i)^2$\. This interaction term represents the energy flux to and from neighboring nodes. The proof now hinges on analyzing this final term.

---

### 9. Derivation Step 3: Change in Interaction Energy

Finally, we analyze the interaction energy term, `\mathcal{I}_i = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \in N(i)} J (W_j - W_i)^2`. Its rate of change is:
$$
\frac{\Delta \mathcal{I}_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{J}{2} \sum_{j \in N(i)} \frac{\Delta(W_j - W_i)^2}{\Delta t}
$$
The change in the squared difference is `\Delta(X^2) \approx 2X \Delta X`. So:
$$
\frac{\Delta \mathcal{I}_i}{\Delta t} \approx \frac{J}{2} \sum_{j \in N(i)} 2(W_j - W_i) \frac{(\Delta W_j - \Delta W_i)}{\Delta t}
$$
Substituting `\Delta W = F(W)\Delta t`, we get:
$$
\frac{\Delta \mathcal{I}_i}{\Delta t} \approx J \sum_{j \in N(i)} (W_j - W_i) (F(W_j) - F(W_i))
$$

### 10. Conclusion of the Proof Attempt

We are trying to prove that `\frac{\Delta \mathcal{H}_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta (\mathcal{K}_i + \mathcal{V}_i)}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta \mathcal{I}_i}{\Delta t}` is equal to zero (or a pure flux term). This requires an exact cancellation:
$$
[F(W_i)]^2 \left(\frac{dF}{dW_i} - 1\right) + J \sum_{j \in N(i)} (W_j - W_i) (F(W_j) - F(W_i)) \stackrel{?}{=} 0
$$
By inspection, there is no apparent reason why these two complex, non-linear terms would algebraically cancel for all possible configurations of `W`. The first term depends only on the state of site `i`, while the second term depends on the state of all its neighbors.

**Finding:** The standard discrete Hamiltonian, `\mathcal{H}_i`, is **not** the conserved quantity for the FUM update rule.

**Interpretation:** This is a significant and non-trivial result. It does not mean the FUM is flawed; it means the FUM is more unique than a standard lattice model. The dissipative on-site dynamics are not balanced in a simple way by the interaction term we postulated. This indicates that either:
a) The FUM is an intrinsically dissipative system where our defined "energy" is not conserved locally.
b) The FUM conserves a different, more complex quantity (a different Hamiltonian) that is not immediately obvious.

**Next Step:** The research path must now pivot from proving the conservation of a postulated Hamiltonian to **discovering the true conserved quantity** of the FUM dynamics. This requires more advanced techniques, such as finding the symmetries of the update rule itself, which is the basis of Noether's theorem. This completes our investigation into the conservation of this specific Hamiltonian.

### 11. Summary and Research Outlook

This investigation aimed to address the critical question of whether the FUM's discrete dynamics obey a local conservation law, a cornerstone of physical theories.

**Summary of Results:**
We began by postulating a standard, physically-motivated Hamiltonian (`\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{K} + \mathcal{V} + \mathcal{I}`) for the discrete nodes of the FUM simulation. Our step-by-step derivation has rigorously shown that the rate of change of this quantity, `\Delta \mathcal{H} / \Delta t`, is non-zero under the FUM's unique update rule.

The on-site potential and kinetic energy terms produce a complex dissipative function, and the standard interaction term does not appear to cancel it in any obvious way. The conclusion is therefore that this simple, standard form of energy is not what is conserved in the FUM.

**Outlook and Next Research Steps:**
This negative result is exceptionally valuable, as it closes a simple avenue and directs our research toward a more fundamental question. The next phase of work is no longer to test a guessed quantity, but to **discover the true conserved quantity** of the FUM. The primary research paths for this are:

1. **Symmetry Analysis (Noether's Theorem):** Investigate the FUM update rule for continuous symmetries. Any identified symmetry will guarantee a corresponding conserved quantity, which would be the "true" Hamiltonian or constant of motion.
2. **Lyapunov Function Analysis:** Frame the FUM as a dynamical system and search for a global Lyapunov function. The system will flow towards minima of this function, and understanding its structure can reveal what is being optimized or conserved.

This concludes the formal proof regarding the standard Hamiltonian and sets a clear, targeted research program for the next stage of FUM's theoretical development.

### 12. The Search for the True Conserved Quantity

Our investigation has successfully shown that a simple, standard definition of energy is not conserved by the FUM. We now pivot from testing a known quantity to discovering a new one. The objective is to find a function `Q(W_i, W_j, ...)`-the true "constant of motion"-such that its total change over one time step is precisely zero.
$$
\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = 0
$$
This is a formidable challenge, as the form of `Q` is not known a priori. There are several advanced methods to approach this problem.

#### Method 1: Direct Algebraic Construction

We could postulate a new conserved quantity `Q = \mathcal{H} + \mathcal{H}_{\text{corr}}`, where `\mathcal{H}` is our original Hamiltonian and `\mathcal{H}_{\text{corr}}` is a correction term. We would then need to solve the equation

$$
\Delta \mathcal{H} / \Delta t = - \Delta \mathcal{H}_{\text{corr}} / \Delta t
$$

Given the complexity of the expression we found for $\Delta\mathcal{H}/\Delta t$\, finding a suitable correction term by direct algebraic manipulation is likely intractable.

#### Method 2: Symmetry via Noether's Theorem

This remains the most elegant and fundamental path forward. As outlined in [`Derivation/symmetry_analysis.md`](Derivation/symmetry_analysis.md:1), Noether's Theorem guarantees that a conserved quantity exists for every continuous symmetry of the system's dynamics. Our initial investigation showed the FUM lacks simple translational or scaling symmetries. The next step would be to search for more complex, non-obvious "hidden" symmetries. This is a significant research task in its own right.

#### Method 3: Information-Theoretic Quantities

Given the FUM's origin in cognitive science and learning, it is plausible that the most fundamental conserved quantity is not a form of physical energy, but a form of **information**. The universe, in the FUM, may not be conserving energy in the simple sense, but it may be conserving a measure of its own complexity or information content.

Potential candidates for an information-theoretic conserved quantity $I$ could be:

- The **Shannon Entropy** of the state distribution: $S = - \sum_i P(W_i) \log P(W_i)$\.
- A **Topological Invariant** of the graph, such as the Betti numbers we have previously discussed, which measure the system's structural complexity.

**Conclusion:**
The search for the true conserved quantity of the FUM is the next major frontier for its theoretical development. We have exhausted the simplest hypothesis and have now clearly defined the advanced research paths required to solve this problem. This concludes our current deep dive into the FUM's mathematical foundations.
