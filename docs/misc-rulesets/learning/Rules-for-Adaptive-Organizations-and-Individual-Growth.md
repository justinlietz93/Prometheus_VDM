## I. Learning & Skill Mastery

1. **Embrace Productive Struggle:** Actively seek out and tolerate difficulty, mistakes, and frustration in learning, as these are essential for building durable and flexible knowledge. Do not rely solely on repetition.
2. **Discern True Learning:** Do not mistake high immediate performance during learning for true mastery; recognize that lasting knowledge often requires a slower, more effortful, and sometimes frustrating process. Guard against the "knowledge mirage."
3. **Optimize Practice Methods:** Prioritize "interleaving" (mixing different types of problems or skills) over "blocked" practice. Implement "spacing" by leaving time between practice sessions for the same material. If self-testing feels too easy, increase the interval before revisiting the material.
4. **Prioritize Broad Thinking:** Teach and train individuals in broad thinking strategies and "open skills" that scaffold future learning and knowledge transfer across domains, rather than focusing solely on what to think or rote memorization of specialized facts.
5. **Cultivate Self-Generated Understanding:** Ensure learning involves struggling to generate answers, even incorrect ones, and actively develop the ability to infer guiding principles from facts and materials without explicit instructions ("eduction").
6. **Diversify Learning Approaches:** For flexible knowledge, learn under varied conditions. For skills requiring deep expertise, engage in deliberate practice with explicit instructions, individual supervision, and immediate feedback. For improvisational skills, learn by imitating and improvising first, then formalizing rules later.
7. **Overlearn Fundamentals:** Master foundational skills comprehensively to provide a robust base for future learning and adaptation.
8. **Embrace Exploration in Education:** Integrate exploration as a central and valued component of all educational and learning initiatives, adopting a "principle of limited sloppiness" to encourage wider inquiry.
9. **Build Transferable Knowledge:** Focus on acquiring and constructing knowledge with enduring utility, enabling its flexible application to new situations and different domains.

### II. Problem Solving & Innovation

1. **Leverage Diverse Analogies:** When facing novel or difficult challenges, actively employ a wide array of analogies, especially distant ones from different domains, to generate solutions. Avoid relying on too few or only superficially similar comparisons.
2. **Identify Deep Structure:** Always determine the fundamental, underlying structure of a problem before attempting to match a strategy or solution to it.
3. **Employ the Outside View:** For critical decision-making and problem-solving, adopt an "outside view" by disregarding unique surface features of the current challenge and seeking structurally similar precedents in unrelated fields.
4. **Avoid Cognitive Entrenchment:** Guard against the "Einstellung effect" by actively seeking and evaluating new or unfamiliar methods, even when familiar ones are available. Drastically vary challenges and maintain an "outside-your-world" perspective to prevent cognitive entrenchment.
5. **Embrace the Unexpected:** View unexpected findings and problems as valuable opportunities for new exploration and learning; allow analogies to guide these ventures.
6. **Catalyze Diverse Solvers:** Frame challenges in ways that attract a broad array of problem solvers, fostering "outside-in" thinking and leveraging the opportunities created by increasing specialization.
7. **Innovate Laterally:** Explore innovation by using old, well-understood, or inexpensive technologies in new, unconventional ways. If deep engagement with new technology is difficult, think broadly about existing technologies.
8. **Avoid Incremental Traps:** Be aware that tools and methods optimized for incremental advancements can actively hinder breakthrough innovation.
9. **Preserve Inefficiency for Breakthroughs:** Intentionally preserve "range" and a degree of "inefficiency" within the innovation ecosystem, especially in basic science, to allow for meandering exploration essential for solving complex challenges and breakthrough discoveries.
10. **Adhere to Proven Design Tenets:** Do not depart from established and proven design principles or philosophies without rigorous justification, especially in product development.

### III. Decision Making & Strategic Planning

1. **Evaluate Broad Options:** For novel problems with high uncertainty, evaluate a wide array of options before allowing intuition to dominate decision-making.
2. **Act on Informed Hunches:** In situations of high uncertainty, leaders must be prepared to act on strong hunches and informal feedback, even when formal recommendations are inconclusive, to proactively investigate potential issues.
3. **Avoid the Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Do not allow past investments (time, money, effort) to compel continued investment in failing endeavors.
4. **Ensure Transparent & Flexible Planning:** In dynamic environments, present plans with transparent rationale and maintain an openness to revision. For mission-critical operations, ensure final recommendations and rationale are thoroughly documented and signed.
5. **Define Quit Conditions:** Before undertaking significant endeavors, explicitly enumerate the conditions under which one should quit or change direction.
6. **Demand Data-Backed Decisions:** Insist that assertions and arguments be supported by quantitative data and admissible evidence; opinions without data are insufficient for critical decisions.
7. **Resist Narrow Focus on Details:** For complex problems, resist the inclination to focus narrowly on many fine details, as this often leads to extreme or incorrect judgments.
8. **Cultivate Diverse Tools:** Develop and utilize a diverse range of tools and approaches for problem-solving and decision-making, avoiding over-reliance on a single specialized tool.

### IV. Organizational & Team Excellence

1. **Foster Diverse Teams:** Form teams with diverse professional backgrounds, high-breadth individuals, and a mixture of specialists and generalists to enhance problem-solving, foster varied analogies, and drive reliable breakthroughs in high-uncertainty domains. Actively avoid homogeneous teams and repeated collaborations in isolated clusters.
2. **Promote Organizational Porosity:** Cultivate porous boundaries between teams and facilitate easy movement of individuals across organizational and disciplinary lines to encourage new collaborations and prevent stagnation.
3. **Encourage Open Communication & Problem Reporting:** Create an environment where employees feel safe and comfortable sharing "crazy ideas" and exposing problems. Actively reward individuals for identifying and reporting issues.
4. **Avoid Mechanistic Hiring:** Shun rigid organizational policies and mechanistic hiring approaches that screen out high-potential innovators with broad interests ("n-shaped people"). When hiring for innovation, prioritize candidates with wide-ranging interests, multiple hobbies, and a focus on systemic interfaces.
5. **Cultivate Cultural Incongruence:** Intentionally build and maintain incongruence within the organizational culture (e.g., balancing standard practice with opposing forces like individualism and conformity) to create cross-checks and promote flexible thought.
6. **Create Space for Unconstrained Exploration:** Establish cultural norms like "dabble time" or "Saturday morning experiments" to provide opportunities for unconstrained, non-rational exploration within the organization.
7. **Contextualize Specialization:** Recognize that while specialization excels in "kind" (predictable) environments, it can be costly and hinder breakthrough innovation in "wicked" (unpredictable) or unclear environments.

### V. Leadership & Culture

1. **Seek Broad Input:** Leaders must actively seek opinions and information from all hierarchy levels, including the lowest, at any time. Investigate repeated hunches, even without immediate data, interrupting usual processes if necessary.
2. **Balance Rigor and Flexibility:** Leaders must balance rigid formal processes and accountability with an informal, individualistic culture that encourages dissent, cross-boundary communication, and opinionated debate.
3. **Embrace Disagreement in Deliberation:** Expect and welcome disagreement during the decision-making phase, viewing it as a sign of organizational health.
4. **Demand Post-Decision Unity:** After decisions are made, require compliance and support for the chosen path, while still permitting professional discussion and learning.
5. **Differentiate Command and Communication:** Clearly distinguish between the chain of command and the chain of communication to foster healthy cross-pressure. Leaders must communicate across all levels but avoid intercepting decisions belonging to the chain of command.
6. **Foster a Culture of Scientific Freedom:** For basic science, advocate for funding models that avoid excessive focus on efficiency or immediate applications, preserving the "free play of intellects" guided by curiosity.

### VI. Individual & Career Development

1. **Embrace "Test-and-Learn":** Adopt a "test-and-learn" approach for career and personal growth over rigid long-term planning. Engage in short-term planning and be a "scientist of yourself," asking smaller, testable questions about potential paths.
2. **Act First, Then Reflect:** For significant career and life changes, prioritize taking action and trying new things over forming a clear picture before acting. Discover personal possibilities through doing, trying new activities, building networks, and finding role models.
3. **Continuously Adapt & Evolve:** Be willing to learn, adjust goals, abandon paths, and change directions entirely if a path is not a good fit. Stay attuned to whether switching is a failure of perseverance or an astute recognition of a better match. Do not be afraid to switch focus for personal reasons.
4. **Avoid Premature Specialization:** Recognize that early specialization is risky as it requires predicting match quality for a person who does not yet fully exist or understand themselves.
5. **Broaden Your Horizon Daily:** Actively read, explore, and engage with knowledge and experiences outside your primary field on a daily basis to broaden perspective and facilitate novel connections.
6. **Compare Against Self:** Do not compare your personal progress to others; instead, benchmark your progress against your own past performance and evolving self.
7. **Maintain Open-Mindedness:** Keep your mind wide open to take something valuable from every new experience and understand that personality changes throughout life, with traits appearing differently in various contexts.
8. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster:** When embarking on new ventures or projects, aim to fail quickly enough to apply the learnings to the next iteration or endeavor.
9. **Guard Against Self-Delusion:** Be aware of the "end of history illusion"—the belief that your future self will not change significantly.
10. **Be Precise in Communication:** When providing information, offer precisely what was asked, no more and no less.

### VII. Cognitive Discipline & Thinking

1. **Cultivate Abstract Thinking:** Develop and practice abstract thinking, which involves the ability to move freely and shift between different categories and attributes. Avoid relying solely on concrete daily experiences.
2. **Recognize Environment Realities:** Guard against the danger of treating a "wicked" (unpredictable) world as if it is "kind" (predictable).
3. **Resist Single-Idea Entrenchment:** Do not become entrenched in a single big idea, as over-reliance can worsen predictions and blind you to other possibilities.
4. **Counter Cognitive Laziness:** Design systems and approaches that counteract the human tendency to seek the least amount of work, particularly when facing conceptual problems with procedural solutions.
5. **Acknowledge Knowledge's Dual Nature:** Understand that knowledge, while empowering, can also be a double-edged sword, enabling certain actions while simultaneously blinding one to others.

### VIII. Communication & Collaboration

1. **Share the Full Story of Discovery:** When sharing discoveries or breakthroughs, convey not just the findings, but also the underlying reasons, challenges, and serendipitous events that led to them.
2. **Disseminate Breakthroughs Widely:** Communicate breakthroughs from specialists quickly and widely to enable their clever application by others.
3. **Implement Robust Feedback Loops:** Establish systems for regular, informal, and cross-divisional problem reporting and feedback to foster continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
4. **Foster a Network of Enterprise:** Actively manage multiple projects or initiatives simultaneously, allowing ideas to "tumble over each other," and dedicate time for informal discussion and synthesis among colleagues.
5. **Cultivate Collaborative Transparency:** In collaborative environments (e.g., superforecasting teams), make commenting an expectation, encourage voting for useful contributions, and recognize members for their process milestones.
