## III. Pedagogy & Student Learning

1. Teaching shall prioritize student understanding of science concepts over merely covering content.
2. Teachers must identify and challenge student misconceptions.
3. Teachers must provide experiences that challenge student preconceptions.
4. Students must actively construct their knowledge; it cannot be merely "told" to them.

6. An explanation that makes sense shall follow a discrepant event.
7. Further testing must follow to validate newly acquired knowledge.
8. Students require time to consolidate and test new ideas in different situations.
9. Learning requires both student and teacher to become conscious of original thoughts and subject ideas to scrutiny.
10. Alternative ideas must be presented through research, experimentation, or teacher guidance.
11. Students are encouraged to ask questions about science topics and design their own experiments.
12. Students must be allowed to practice thinking for themselves rather than memorizing answers.
13. Teachers shall be alert for and learn to use discrepant events in class to build interest in a concept.
14. Teachers must learn to question in ways that stimulate student thinking rather than closing it off, using probing and "what if" questions.
15. Teachers must make topics relevant and purposeful to students' lives.
16. Teachers must foster a classroom culture where students feel it is their job to figure out problems and make sense of them.
17. Each student shall be responsible for their own thinking, recognizing there are no "dumb" ideas when seeking solutions together.
18. Students shall speak when they have something to say, not wildly guess.
19. Students must not accept information as presented without scrutiny, but rather look at it critically and make informed decisions (as a goal for responsible citizens).

22. Students must be able to give a reason or justification for any answer they suggest.
23. Teachers must develop students' abilities to design their own experiments.
    * Students must be able to ask relevant questions, distinguish between dependent and independent variables (one at a time), recognize the importance of repetitions, know how to collect results with appropriate data tables, learn to graph data, interpret data and graphs, and communicate interpretations.
    * Teachers must model experimental aspects and build student repertoire gradually.
24. Teachers must include science content in all science activities and teach process skills and content hand-in-hand.
25. Teachers shall use the 5-E learning cycle: Engage (interest), Explore (subject), Explain (concepts), Extend (new information), and conduct formative Evaluation throughout the unit.
26. Teachers must focus on a few topics in greater depth rather than superficially covering many.
27. Teachers must explicitly model expected social skills (e.g., direct eye contact, firm handshake, strong voice) and problem-solving behaviors for students in cooperative groups.
28. Teachers must complete every assignment they ask their students to perform, keep a notebook like students, and model by reading their written essays to the class.
29. In cooperative learning, if one partner experiences difficulty (e.g., shyness, fear, or understanding), the other partner must assist to ensure success.
30. Problems given by the teacher must be related to real life.
31. When analyzing dilemmas, students must evaluate their beliefs against others, find information from multiple perspectives, and make informed decisions.
32. For experiential activities like "Phases of the Moon," each student must directly experience the phenomenon (e.g., being in the earth position) rather than passively observing a demonstration.
    * For the "Phases of the Moon" activity, the "moon" person must take seven steps in each quarter quadrant, walking counterclockwise around the "earth" person, and the "earth" person must spin one complete turn for each step of the "moon" person.

## IV. Classroom Environment & Resources

1. The Model Lab classroom design shall include moveable tables for flexible space, no fixed demonstration bench blocking the front, and lab tables arranged in a spoke design around a pedestal sink for safety and open spaces.
2. The Model Lab shall provide teachers immediate access to an extensive library (books, journals, laser discs, curriculum packages, technology).
3. Computers must be used as learning tools, not as games or electronic worksheets.
4. The learning environment must ensure children feel secure, accepted, and valued to be receptive to learning.

## V. Assessment Principles & Practices

1. When teaching priorities are altered, assessment methods and priorities must also be adjusted.
2. Teachers must use methods where children prove or demonstrate their learning.
3. The Model Lab encourages a wide variety of assessments (e.g., competitions, debates, newscasts, illustrated books, performances, multimedia, cartoon strips, concept maps, narrative writing, skits, interviews, songs, self-assessment, group assessments, rubrics).
4. Student project grades shall be based on presentations with convincing support for their ideas, justified by evidence.

16. Workshops must select activities that instruct participants on both content and constructivist methodology.
17. Workshops must include demonstrations of appropriate assessment and resource use.
18. Workshop production requires a coordinated division of responsibilities.
19. Workshop sessions must be restricted to a small group (24-28 participants).

22. Team members must actively help each other.
23. When expressing anger to maintain communication or bring about change, it must be expressed positively, using the formula: "When you..., I feel..., Because..."

## Key Highlights

* The Model Lab program is mandated to provide extensive support, professional development, and a supportive network to empower teachers and foster their reflective abilities and professional identity.
* Teaching shall prioritize child-centered, constructivist learning, focusing on students' deep understanding of science concepts and actively challenging their misconceptions through engaging experiences.
* Resident teachers commit to a full year of intensive professional development, including a reduced course load, university credit, scientist mentorship, classroom observations, and maintaining a reflective journal, learning constructivist methods firsthand.
* Instruction must utilize the 5-E learning cycle (Engage, Explore, Explain, Extend, Evaluate) and focus on fewer topics in greater depth, with teachers employing questioning techniques that stimulate student thinking.
* Students are encouraged to actively construct knowledge, ask questions, design their own experiments, critically scrutinize information, and justify their answers to foster independent thinking and problem-solving.
* Assessment methods must align with the program's pedagogical priorities, requiring children to prove or demonstrate their learning through a wide variety of authentic, project-based activities.
* The Model Lab classroom design features flexible, moveable furniture and immediate access to extensive resources, while adhering to budget restrictions to ensure replicability.
* Effective professional collaboration is essential, requiring compatible team teaching, extensive preplanning, continuous in-classroom support, and active, positive communication among all participants.

## Example ideas

* Investigate current Model Lab classroom construction costs against HISD budget restrictions to ensure replicability and identify cost-optimization strategies for future expansion.
* Establish a robust evaluation framework and data collection plan to measure the program's impact on teacher efficacy, student learning outcomes, and the sustained adoption of constructivist pedagogies.
* Conduct an audit of the existing partner network to assess engagement, identify underutilized resources, and develop strategies for strengthening collaboration to support program goals.
* Develop a strategy to track the long-term professional development and pedagogical influence of Resident teachers after their return to home schools, including sustained support and opportunities for continued peer learning.
