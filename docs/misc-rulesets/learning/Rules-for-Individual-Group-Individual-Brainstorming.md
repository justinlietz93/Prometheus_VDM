# Rules for Individual-Group-Individual Brainstorming

**Generated on:** October 3, 2025 at 2:45 AM CDT

---

## **Overall Procedure (I-G-I)**

* Implement the Individual-Group-Individual (I-G-I) brainstorming procedure.

## **Instruction Requirements**

* Provide brainstorming instructions to participants.
* Emphasize the quantity of ideas, not quality, in initial instructions.
* Explicitly instruct participants to "Go for quantity, ignore quality."
* Rule out criticism during initial idea generation.
* Withhold adverse judgment of ideas until later phases.
* Welcome "free-wheeling" and wild ideas.
* Encourage the combination and improvement of ideas.

## **Goal Setting**

* Set a specific, difficult target for the number of ideas participants must generate.
* Ensure the target is numerically specific.
* Define a "difficult" target as a number of ideas attainable by only 20% of participants working on the task under no-target conditions.

## **Initial Idea Generation (Individual Phase)**

* Individuals, not groups, must generate initial creative ideas.
* Individuals must work alone or privately (if in the same room) during initial idea generation.
* Do not use group brainstorming for initial creative idea generation.
* Individuals must write down or key in ideas without talking.
* Limit initial idea generation time to approximately fifteen minutes.

## **Idea Amalgamation & Refinement (Group Phase)**

* Use group interaction to amalgamate and refine ideas after initial individual generation.
* Form groups of five to seven individuals for this phase.
* During this phase, participants must be seated around a table in the same room.
* The group leader must take ideas serially, one idea per person per rotation.
* The group leader must record all ideas on a common, anonymous, group-visible list (e.g., flip chart, electronic screen).
* Record ideas without authorship.
* Allow equal time for discussion of each idea.
* Encourage refinement of initial ideas and "hitchhiking" (combining ideas) during group discussion.
* Provide every individual an opportunity to state reasons for agreement or disagreement with each idea, and to make constructive suggestions for improvement.
* Ideas must be taken one at a time during group discussion.

## **Final Idea Selection (Individual Voting Phase)**

* Perform final selection of creative ideas through private individual evaluation.
* Individuals must rate or rank revised ideas privately.
* No discussion is allowed during individual rating or ranking.
* Choose the best idea(s) by pooled individual votes.
* All participants must have an equal say in final idea selection.

## **Leadership & Facilitation**

* The chairperson must announce the problem and provide brainstorming instructions.
* Do not use autocratic or directive leadership during evaluation and selection phases.
* The leader must refrain from stating their own preferences until all members have expressed theirs.
* The leader must encourage discussion of alternative solutions.
* The leader must emphasize the importance of reaching a correct solution (quality of decision).

## **Timing Constraints**

* Do not rely on or require an incubation period for brainstorming.
* The overall I-G-I procedure should not exceed approximately two hours from start to completion.

## Key Highlights

* Implement the Individual-Group-Individual (I-G-I) brainstorming procedure for comprehensive idea generation and selection.
* Emphasize quantity over quality in initial idea generation instructions, explicitly telling participants to 'Go for quantity, ignore quality' and welcome 'free-wheeling' ideas.
* Rule out criticism and withhold adverse judgment of ideas during initial phases to encourage uninhibited thought.
* Set a specific, difficult numerical target for the number of ideas participants must generate, aiming for a challenging yet attainable goal.
* Individuals, not groups, must generate initial creative ideas alone or privately, writing them down without talking, and limiting this phase to approximately fifteen minutes.
* After individual generation, use group interaction in groups of five to seven to amalgamate and refine ideas, recording all ideas anonymously on a common, visible list.
* Perform the final selection of creative ideas through private individual evaluation, where individuals rate or rank revised ideas without discussion, and the best are chosen by pooled votes.
* The entire I-G-I procedure, from start to completion, should not exceed approximately two hours.

## Example ideas

* Develop a comprehensive training program for facilitators to ensure consistent application of the specific I-G-I rules and leadership styles.
* Establish a robust methodology for accurately determining the 'difficult' idea generation target (attainable by 20% under no-target conditions) for various problem types.
* Conduct a pilot implementation of the full I-G-I procedure with a representative problem and team to validate the 2-hour timing and identify any practical bottlenecks or areas for refinement.
* Define clear metrics and a post-session evaluation framework to assess both the quantity and, ultimately, the quality of generated ideas, as well as the overall effectiveness of the I-G-I process in problem-solving.
