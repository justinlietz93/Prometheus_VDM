## I. Overarching Principles for Learning Environments

1. **Emphasize Authentic, Complex, and Project-Based Learning:** Learning environments shall be organized around larger, functional construction tasks or projects that unify and purpose learning, providing realistic levels of complexity rather than simplification. These global tasks must be closely tied to real-world transfer environments and drive the purpose of learning activities. Instruction must aid learners in functioning within complex environments, actively searching for new strategies to support them.
2. **Foster Learner Ownership and Metacognition:** Learners shall have ownership of their learning and performance, controlling their learning process and being supported in establishing and monitoring their goals and strategies. Environments must require learners to reflect on the quality of their theories, judgments, decisions, and processes (reflection-in-action and reflection-on-actions). Educational systems shall gradually allocate greater authority and responsibility to the learner as their ability to understand or relate information increases.
3. **Promote Multiple Perspectives and Context Variety:** Authentic activities shall promote seeing problems and tasks from different perspectives. Instruction shall provide numerous examples of concepts and vary their contexts widely to represent the full range of possible appearances, enabling learners to study multiple cases with different goals and purposes.
4. **Prioritize Contextual Meaningfulness:** Information learned without a real-world, relevant context will be less meaningful. Learning environments must establish context to simulate real-world complexity, and context and authentic activities shall not be compromised. Reduced context diminishes learning meaningfulness. Instruction must provide contextually-based environments that are meaningful to the learners.
5. **Adhere to Constructivist Principles for Knowledge Acquisition:**
    * **Knowledge Construction:** Learners shall construct knowledge by actively interpreting perceptual experiences through prior knowledge, mental structures, and beliefs. Knowledge is internally generated by the individual, not received from external sources. The mind must be instrumental in interpreting events and forming personal knowledge.
    * **Meaning Creation:** Meaning shall be a function of individual creation from experiences.
    * **Generative Processing:** Understanding shall result from generative processing, which involves relating new information to prior knowledge to build more elaborate knowledge structures. Knowledge structures are necessary for interpreting new information, reasoning, and problem-solving.
    * **Social Negotiation:** Common understandings shall regularly result from social negotiation of meaning, supported by collaborative knowledge construction. Understandings and instructional outcomes can be negotiated between learners and teachers.
    * **Accept Diverse Interpretations:** Learning environment designers must accept varied learner interpretations rather than imposing a prescribed objective reality on learners.
    * **Cognitive Development:** Cognitive development shall occur through the internalization of cognitive activity originally experienced in social contexts.
    * **Situational Learning:** To develop flexibly applicable knowledge, learning must occur in situated contexts which incorporate explicit cognitive processes with authentic application situations.
    * **Avoid Decontextualized Information:** Instructional methods designed solely to pass on knowledge as separate, decontextualized pieces of information shall be avoided, as they miss the whole essence of how knowledge is constructed and understanding developed.
6. **Balance Contextualization and Decontextualization:** A balance must be maintained between contextualization (e.g., situating learning to relate knowledge to action, creating meaningful problem contexts, emphasizing application contexts) and decontextualization (e.g., including different examples, bridging domains, fostering abstraction) in learning.
7. **Focus on Useful, Transferable Knowledge:** Useful knowledge is defined as that which can be transferred to new situations. Instructional strategies shall aim to develop flexibly applicable knowledge by situating learning, emphasizing application contexts (both potential and non-potential), and examining subject matter from multiple points of view. Information, to be useful, must be applied in some way.
8. **Manage Learning Guidance and Scaffolding:** Initial schema development and knowledge acquisition shall be guided more closely than advanced knowledge acquisition. Scaffolding must be prioritized in early stages and gradually removed to maximize independent student performance. When teaching students how to learn independently, teachers shall first take over important learning activities, then teach students to execute and regulate them, gradually replacing activations with stimulations.
9. **Apply Constructivism Thoughtfully and Contextually:** Constructivistic learning approaches and environments are not equally suitable for all learning contexts and should not be the sole learning model. They are most reliably applied to the advanced knowledge acquisition stage of learning. The specific learning phase must be considered before recommending any specific methodology, especially constructivistic approaches. Browsing in a domain for which no properly developed schemata exist is unlikely to lead to satisfactory knowledge acquisition.
10. **Maintain Creative Tension in Pedagogy:** The creative tension between constructivist and more conventional ways of thinking and teaching shall not be destroyed by too readily accepting one extreme or the other. Teachers have a professional responsibility to avoid teaching in overly extreme ways. Constructivist techniques can run in parallel with more conventional approaches.

### II. Instructional Design & Pedagogy

1. **Adopt the Apprenticeship Model (Cognitive Apprenticeship):** The apprenticeship model shall be adopted for instruction to embed learning in a larger, functional context. Programs must explicitly model strategies in their usual context, inform students of the need and utility of strategies, and ensure students realize the strategies work for them. Responsibility shall be transferred gradually, and internalization of strategies challenged incrementally, with tailored feedback and encouragement. These programs must involve socially shared intellectual work, be organized around mutual task accomplishment, make hidden processes overt, allow skill to build incrementally, and be organized around specific subject matters rather than general abilities.
2. **Promote Self-Regulated Learning:**
    * **Explicitly Teach Skills:** Learners shall be taught how to learn in a constructive, self-regulated way, with self-regulatory skills explicitly planned into instructional design.
    * **Organize Learning Environments:** Learning environments shall explicitly organize the five aspects of self-regulated learning: preparation, learning skills, self-regulation, judgment and feedback, and motivation and concentration.
    * **Learner Responsibilities:** Students must elaborate and relate new information to prior knowledge for meaningful retention. They shall monitor, self-test, and check their progress, becoming aware of their learning processes. Learners shall observe and interpret their own behavior and thinking, and control whether they are on target, judging their performance independently and using feedback optimally without resorting to cheating. Reflective periods should occur, but not continuously.
3. **Integrate "Learning to Learn" into Curriculum:** A program concerned with "learning how to learn" has to start in primary schools and work across all sections. General "learning to learn" courses have historically failed; therefore, learning to learn approaches must be embedded or immersed directly within constructive learning environments and domain-specific instruction. Learners must be taught how to behave in constructive learning environments, and teachers educated on how to use them.
4. **Rethink Teacher Roles and Provide Robust Professional Development:** Teachers' roles shall be re-evaluated to encompass managing the learning process, guiding pupils, assessing progress, and direct teaching, broadening their repertoire of teaching skills. Continuous professional development for teachers must be a core component, with significant budget and time allocations (e.g., 10-15% of normal staffing quota). This development shall include secondments into local or national working environments for practical inquiry into organizational expectations, professional development planning, or utilization of technological change.
5. **Focus on Real Professional Problems:** Instruction must focus on real professional problems (e.g., through problem descriptions) to help students connect their learning directly and clearly to professional practice. A direct connection and integration of attempts to teach students how to learn and solve problems with domain-specific normal instruction is of vital importance.
6. **Implement Phased Learning Models:**
    * **Leittext Method:** Learning shall be structured in six phases: informing, planning, deciding, executing, controlling, and evaluating. Initial usage involves detailed steps, which transition to activation and stimulation as learners become more accustomed, gradually withdrawing external regulation. Adaptations shall incorporate possibilities for orientation and planning during or even after the completion of construction activities, prioritizing "on-the-job" applications or real-life simulations.
    * **Problem-Oriented Learning:** Instruction shall consist of fixed phases: problem discussion, analysis, hypothesis generation, finding knowledge gaps, deciding on individual learning goals, individual study, and synthesis. Students must receive a written problem description that is as realistic as possible. Their task is to analyze it and generate hypotheses, not simply solve it, and to identify what they know and their knowledge gaps. Problems must have a close link to later professional practice.
7. **Design for Cooperative Learning:** Learning adventures and activities should be designed for use in cooperative learning settings, providing opportunities for students to work in groups, define, and research issues related to learning activities.
8. **Ensure Curriculum Coherence and Continuum:** The curriculum shall be planned as a single entity, not separate disciplines, with clear overall objectives in terms of skills, attitudes, concepts, and knowledge, incorporating formal, informal, and extra-curricular responses to pupil needs. It must be designed as a continuum, with a clear understanding of skills to be learned at various stages, ensuring proper primary-secondary transfer planning. Curriculum aims must foster a positive attitude towards and competence in technical skills and personal attributes for creative, contributory lives in a modern technological society.
9. **Plan Constructive Learning Thoroughly:** Constructive learning environments do not automatically result in constructive learning. Constructive learning must be planned thoroughly and embedded into the total instructional design. Learners and teachers cannot be expected to learn constructively only during a part of their school days and return to habitual learning the rest of the time.

### III. Technology & System Design

1. **General Technology Principles:**
    * **Support Advanced Knowledge Acquisition:** Modern information technology can and should support advanced knowledge acquisition by providing environments and thinking tools that engage constructivistic conceptions of learning. Universities and tertiary education institutions are appropriate venues for this.
    * **Act as a Mediator and Tool Kit:** Technology shall not attempt to replace the teacher but serve as an instrument that helps students reflect on their learning process and check it consciously, mediating between child, teacher, and the object of knowledge. Computers should provide tool kits that enable students to build more meaningful, personal interpretations, and these tool kits must support the requisite intellectual functionality of the course of study. An application becomes a tool only if the learner uses it to represent their own understanding.
    * **Promote Active, Social Interaction:** Technological learning environments must break models that reproduce passive habits by promoting a social and active style of interaction. The design of technology shall be explicitly focused on social interactions and communication. Empty and open systems should reify a conceptual and cognitive trajectory, allowing users to actively contribute while maintaining task complexity.
    * **Be Open, Flexible, and Adaptive:** Technology-based learning systems are generally more powerful, flexible, and fault-tolerant when their degrees of freedom or openness can be adjusted to the needs and capacities of learners and learning communities. Systems responsive to varying requirements for openness are more likely to degrade gracefully. Constraints should be present in empty and open systems to sustain user knowledge construction and prevent getting lost, including a structure and clues for exploration.
    * **Avoid "Full" and "Closed" Systems:** It is necessary to build and use empty and open technologies rather than technologies already "full" of knowledge, to respect the constructive and social nature of learning. Designing "full" and "closed" systems with a high level of directiveness will reproduce passive school learning effects and inhibit educational innovation.
    * **Integrate Cognitive Research and Ergonomics:** Instructional design must incorporate the results of basic cognitive research regarding user characteristics and consider studies of competence development in experts and everyday cognitive functioning. "Ergonomics of educational technology" needs to be constructed for the cognitive and educative design of new technology, aiming for cognitive (not merely physical) compatibility between technology and the individual.
    * **Ensure Organizational Coherence:** Organizational coherence is necessary between technologies and the educational contexts in which they are used to avoid confusing effects. Designers ought to be sensitive to the socially organized settings in which technology might function and use the organizational change that technology produces as a mediator to amplify educative interaction.
    * **Prioritize Interface Design for Reflection:** Interfaces must reify implicit aspects of the learner’s cognition to make them more available for reflection and learning.
    * **Adapt Technical Design Philosophy:** Technicians should abandon the idea that design problems can be solved only by adopting a common-sense theory of the learning process. Cognitive and educational psychologists should adopt an "ergonomic" perspective to design and implement educational contexts and cognitive technologies.
2. **User Interface & Experience (General):**
    * Systems must be highly self-explanatory, menu-driven, and mouse-driven.
    * A help-facility outlining the program structure must be available at any point.
    * User-friendliness for the target demographic (e.g., elementary school pupils) shall be prioritized.
3. **Error Handling & Feedback (General):**
    * Instructions containing syntactical errors shall not be carried out; an error message must be provided (e.g., from the turtle).
    * When syntactical errors are present in a program, the pupil must receive an error message and return to the editor for correction.
4. **Hypertext and Semantic Network Systems (SemNet):**
    * **Management:** Complex hypertext and hypermedia systems require computers to manage the display of information units and relational links.
    * **Conversion Process:** When converting a SemNet path to HyperCard, the path shall first be extracted as an ASCII text file, then transformed into a HyperCard stack where each node is a card. The node-label must be automatically placed as a "title" text field, and each link represented as a button ("hot spot").
    * **Button Labeling:** The system shall afford three options for automatic button labeling: display only relational label, display only related concept label, or display both.
    * **Relational Descriptors:** When constructing a SemNet, a standard set of relational descriptors supplied to novices requires them to invent fewer elements "from scratch." Relational descriptors shall end in a vowel (e.g., "a") to denote "meta-verbs," not requiring conjugation, making node-link-node sequences sound more natural and blurring perceived disagreements in tense. Users adding additional relational descriptors are encouraged to suffix an "a."
    * **User Control:** The individual user must be free to modify the system of relations by augmenting relationship symbols.
    * **Navigation:** Users must forgo continuous navigation through information-dense media blocks in SemNet and focus on links as the basis for organization.
    * **Link Meaning:** The degree to which the system provides information about the meaning of a link is a means for controlling the level of system support for constructive mental activity.
    * **Configuration Management:** Knowledgeable net authors/designers shall assign numbers as "place-holders" for unlabeled links and nodes when omissions are called for, allowing the learner to change them to appropriate labels using existing SemNet authoring capabilities.
    * **Formal Structure:** Some sort of formal structure must be imposed onto the hypertext to avoid random connections.
    * **Representation Limits:** It may not be possible to represent all important domains of human knowledge in the form of propositional or semantic networks.

### IV. Assessment & Evaluation

1. **Align Assessment with Learning Goals:** Assessments must be motivated by a theoretical perspective and designed to be sensitive to that perspective. If constructivist learning environments and methods are used, divergent types of processing need to be evaluated as well as convergent expectations.
2. **Evaluate Higher-Order Thinking and Knowledge Construction:** Traditional measures of recall cannot be used to assess outcomes of constructivist environments. Assessment shall require students to generate sub-goals, identify relevant information, and solve new problems. It must assess the intellectual processes of knowledge construction, not repetition, focusing on higher-order thinking.
3. **Evaluate in Authentic Context:** Evaluation shall occur under conditions grounded in perception and experience, not behavior elicited by arbitrary requirements. It is important to evaluate how learners go about constructing knowledge and what they are able to transfer in case-based worlds. The simple application of incremental knowledge must be carefully distinguished from the more complex applications of knowledge possible on the basis of conceptual understanding.
4. **Integrate Assessment and Accept Multiple Perspectives:** Effective assessment shall be integrated into the instructional process. It is equally important to reflect and accept multiple perspectives in the evaluation process. Learning should be referenced by a domain of possible outcomes, each providing acceptable evidence of learning.
5. **Require New Evaluation Assumptions for Constructivism:** No efforts at integrating constructivist principles in instruction shall be attempted without requiring a new set of assumptions about how learning is to be evaluated. Conventional, objectivist evaluation techniques would be absurd in judging the effectiveness of constructivist interventions. Providing a constructivist teaching environment will have little effect on the quality of learning while conventional assessment procedures remain in place.

### V. Organizational & Systemic Change

1. **Empower Lifelong Learners and Foster Key Skills:** Educational systems shall empower young people to view continuous learning as a means of transformation, fostering mastery of learning skills and individual responsibility for lifelong learning (70+ years after leaving school). The system shall aim for functional literacy, defined as comfort with all the change of a rapidly evolving, highly technological society, developing key skills of thinking, communicating, collaborating, and decision-making. Universities exist to foster advanced knowledge acquisition and produce reflective practitioners.
2. **Cultivate School-Community Partnerships:** School and community must work together to provide learning opportunities, marshalling all resources and considering all community influences to achieve high standards. Every adult in the community shall be involved in teaching communication and collaboration skills. The community must be fully involved, providing leadership, ideas, finance, security, and fostering the development of relationships. Misconceptions and negative attitudes towards schools and learning, uncovered through community engagement, must be handled with the greatest delicacy, with constant reminders that high-quality provision ("what is good enough for the rich") needs to be the standard for all.
3. **Allocate Resources for Professional Development and Innovation:** A significant portion of the staffing quota or teaching budget (e.g., 10-15% of normal staffing, or 10% of teaching budget in Phase 3) must be allocated for continuous teacher professional development. Teachers shall be provided with time, support, and resources to develop current practices as a team, defining their own equipment needs. Investment in the management skills of senior and middle-level staff is crucial to support new and flexible learning arrangements.
4. **Integrate Programs to Prevent Sectionalization:** Every teacher must be involved in at least two (preferably three) central program components to prevent sectionalization.
5. **Prioritize a Long-Term IT Strategy:** A long-term view of information technology's impact on schools, learning skills, and teacher practice must be taken, using IT to individualize learning and redeploy teacher skills. IT shall be introduced as a catalyst for significant change, shifting curriculum focus from teaching to learning.
6. **Ensure Equitable Technology Access and Use:** The population shall be equipped with technological literacy equivalent to the three Rs as a desirable norm. Students must learn to use technologies for their own purposes (investigating, problem-solving, simulating, calculating, and processing data), empowered to control technology for a liberating, not limiting, effect. School networks must support immediate word-search access to library records from any part of the school.
7. **Commitment and Funding for Program Success:** A wholehearted commitment by all partners to program ideals and a determination to follow innovation through to its natural conclusions is required. Better networking of existing innovation and programs must be established, and reasonable security of funding across programs secured for logical planning. Projects need protection from changing external political expectations and time to evolve.
8. **Support Parents in Understanding New Learning Strategies:** Parents must be provided with as much help as teachers in understanding the implications of changed learning strategies for themselves.
9. **Adhere to Organizational Subsidiarity:** The principle of subsidiarity must be adhered to, empowering lower bodies to make decisions within their expertise. This means abandoning outdated instructional models that inhibit pupil self-improvement and ownership of learning.

### VI. System-Specific Requirements

#### A. Jasper Series

1. **Video Content & Structure:**
    * **Length:** Main story videos must have a main story length of 14 to 18 minutes.
    * **Problem Generation:** The end of each video must feature a character stating the problem to be solved as a challenge, requiring students to generate sub-problems for solution.
    * **Embedded Data:** All data required to solve a problem must be provided within the video as a natural part of the story.
    * **Conclusion:** Each Jasper adventure must include a conclusion viewable only after students solve the problem.
    * **Paired Adventures:** Jasper adventures must be organized into pairs, with each pair member involving similar problem types.
2. **Design Principles:**
    * **Video-Based Narrative:** Use a video-based, narrative format with realistic problems (rather than a lecture on video).
    * **Generative Format:** Employ a generative format where stories end, and students must generate the problems to be solved.
    * **Problem Complexity:** Design problems with at least 14 steps of complexity.
    * **Cross-Curricular Links:** Provide and facilitate embedding information for cross-curricular links.
    * **Accessibility:** The video format must make complex mathematics problem-solving accessible to students with reading difficulties.
    * **Teachable Moments:** Jasper adventures must be designed to create "teachable moments" for meaningful knowledge acquisition.
    * **Gestalt Integration:** All design principles must operate as a Gestalt, mutually influencing each other.
3. **Instructional Goals & Approach:**
    * **Independent Thinking:** The Jasper series must help all students become independent thinkers and learners, beyond basic computations and knowledge retrieval.
    * **Problem Identification:** Students must learn to identify and define issues and problems independently rather than simply respond to posed problems.
    * **Generative Learning Activities:** Allow students to engage in generative learning activities to develop problem generation and monitoring abilities.
    * **Scaffolding Strategy:** Prioritize scaffolding in the early stages of the Jasper series, maximizing the removal of scaffolds to enable independent student performance.
    * **Complementary Exercises:** Basic exercises must be used in conjunction with Jasper series work.
    * **Group Work:** Provide opportunities for students to work in groups, define, and research issues related to Jasper adventures.
4. **Assessment:** Assessments must require students to generate sub-goals, identify relevant information, and solve new problems.

#### B. Bubble Dialogue System

1. **Core Functionality:**
    * **Role Play & Dialogue Creation:** Bubble dialogue must combine elements of role play, dialogue creation, and reflexive dialogue analysis. Users must play out the parts of characters on the computer screen, creating and reflecting upon dialogue in both the characters' private domain (thoughts/inner speech) and public domain (public speech).
    * **Versatility:** The tool must allow dialogue creation between any characters in any context.
2. **User Interface & Interaction:**
    * **Page Structure:** Each page of a bubble dialogue stack must contain four icons, representing a speech bubble and a think bubble per character.
    * **Creation Mode Constraints:** In creation mode, movement must only be forward to the next chosen empty speech or think bubble. A turn-taking protocol must be implemented, ensuring the two characters take turns to "speak" (and optionally "think"), preventing users from making either character have an extended conversation with himself or herself. Once a character has had one speech (and optionally one thought), the user’s only course of action must be to transfer attention to what the other character is going to be made to say or think.
    * **Review Mode Functionality:** In review mode, users must be able to move backwards and forwards through the dialogue at will, adding notes, editing the text of the dialogue, adding thoughts or speech where they did not previously exist, or extending the dialogue beyond its "ending."
3. **Teacher Controls:** Implement teacher controls (via a reserved keystroke) for setting/resetting options such as unlocking/locking existing text for editing, allowing/disallowing new think or say bubbles, changing character names, allowing/disallowing lookbacks, and changing text size.
4. **Output & Archiving:**
    * **Printout Options:** Users must have access to a printout of the dialogue. Clicking on the printer icon shall produce a comic strip version of the dialogue. An icon adjacent to the printer icon must produce an annotated script.
    * **Continuous Archiving:** The bubble dialogue tool must continuously create an archive, serving as a repository of information such as user edits of speech/thought bubbles and the sequence of adding notes during the review process.

#### C. Logo-Based Tool-Kit and Computer Coach

1. **System Architecture (Three Levels):**
    * **Level 1 (Traditional Logo):** This level must enable pupils to write Logo commands and programs for making drawings (traditional turtle graphics). It shall have two major parts: an execution part and an editor. The top part of the execution screen must be taken by the execution window with the turtle, and in the text window at the bottom, the pupil can type Logo commands that are executed immediately.
    * **Level 2 (Planning & Debugging Tools):** This level must provide two additional tools that stimulate and facilitate planning and debugging activities. Pupils must be able to choose whether or not to use these tools.
    * **Level 3 (Computer Coach):** This level must include a computer coach that analyzes pupil activities and gives comments and orienting help based on a comparison between the pupil’s activities and the expert programming strategy. Two types of coaching, differing in terms of the rigor of the diagnosis and the subsequent messages, must be implemented.
2. **Hardware Requirements:** The system must be developed for use on MS-DOS personal computers with minimally one disk-drive and must drive EGA, VGA, and Hercules graphics cards.
3. **User Interface:** The system must be highly self-explanatory, menu-driven, and mouse-driven, prioritizing user-friendliness for elementary school pupils. A help-facility which outlines the program structure must be available at any point.
4. **System Design:** Design the system as an easily extendable and modifiable prototype, allowing smooth conversions to other natural and programming languages.
5. **Level 1 Specifics:**
    * **Logo Primitives:** Logo primitives must be limited to essential turtle graphics commands (forward (FD), back (BK), right (RT), left (LT), penup (PU), pendown (PD), clearscreen (CS), and home). The system must also allow the use of procedures (possibly with parameters), iteration, recursion, conditional statements, and the stop-command.
    * **Language Help & Teacher Control:** At any time, the user can consult a list of all available Logo primitives (language help). The teacher must have the possibility to suppress particular Logo primitives and concepts.
    * **Editor:** To write a procedure or a program, the pupil has to switch to the editor. The editor must closely resemble a word-processor, allowing the insertion and deletion of characters, and have facilities for copying, moving, deleting, and tracing blocks. It must be possible to copy a block of text from another program that has been saved on a disk (file management).
    * **Program Flow & Error Handling:** After finishing a program, the pupil must indicate in the menu that they want to go to the execution part. When a program is called by typing its name, the entire program must be checked first. If a program does not contain syntactical errors, it is executed. If syntactical errors are present, the pupil must receive an error message and has to go back to the editor to correct the bug.
6. **Level 2 Specifics (Planning & Debugging Tools):**
    * **Planning Tool:** The planning tool must be a graphical editor that allows the construction and manipulation of a graphic representation of the structure of a program in the form of a tree-like diagram. It must have special boxes for procedures, procedures with parameters, iteration, recursion, and conditional statements. The plan should not contain any Logo primitives (except the stop-command) to maintain abstraction. The planning tool must allow the pupil to add, delete, replace, and rename parts of the tree-like diagram in an easy and flexible way. The plan and the corresponding program can be saved together under a common name, and the constructed tree-like diagram must also be available on the screen in the editor.
    * **Debugging Tool:** The debugging tool must enable pupils to view the code and the corresponding graphical output together on the screen, with each command highlighted as it is being executed. Execution speed must be adjustable, and procedures must be able to be carried out step-by-step (with the name of the actual procedure and the actual values of its parameters available upon request after each step).
7. **Level 3 Specifics (Computer Coach):**
    * **Comprehensive Error Checking:** At Level 3, the coach must check the pupils’ activities in both the planning phase and the coding-and-testing phase. In both phases, the coach must examine syntactic and semantic errors, and errors with respect to the programming strategy.
    * **Planning Phase Checks:** In the planning phase, the coach must check syntactic and semantic aspects of the pupil's input during tree-like diagram construction (e.g., procedure names, parameters, iteration repeats, conditional statements). The coach must identify as syntactical errors procedure names starting with a numerical character, Logo primitives or reserved words used as procedure names, or formal parameters not preceded by a colon. The coach must identify as semantic errors a repeat or conditional construct containing no statement, formal parameters defined but not used, or statements placed after the stop-command. The coach must react when certain criteria for an expert tree-diagram are not fulfilled (e.g., too many subprocedures at the same level, identical procedures defined twice, or a procedure having a subprocedure with the same name without explicit recursion definition).
    * **Coding & Testing Phase Checks:** In the editor, the coach must react when the syntax of the programming code is not correct and when the semantics of the code are not in accordance with the plan. The coach must examine if the pupil has taken into account top-down programming and immediate testing and debugging principles. The coach must verify that the pupil starts with coding the mother procedure, and that the names and sequence of parts correspond with the second level of the tree-like diagram. The tree-like diagram must be converted to code according to the depth-first method. The coach must require the pupil to run the program each time a new procedure is defined.
    * **Execution Guidance:** Execution must stop when an unknown procedure is encountered. The coach must ensure the pupil knows which procedure has to be defined next when execution halts.
    * **Adaptive Coaching:** At sublevel 1, the coach gives only a warning when an error is made, and the pupil has the option to ignore this warning. At sublevel 2, error messages from the coach must be binding, preventing the pupil from proceeding if the fault is not corrected or if the prescribed step from the programming strategy is not followed. If the pupil does not see the fault immediately, they can ask for additional help, and the coach will provide a clarifying message. The rigor of coaching can be adapted to the competency and the needs of the pupil.
    * **Instructional Sequence:** Strict guidance of the computer coach at Level 3.2 should be preceded by Logo lessons where pupils discover and discuss the value of efficient planning and debugging strategies. Lessons at Level 3.2 should be followed by sessions where pupils decide whether to follow coach suggestions (Level 3.1) or use available tools (Level 2). Overall, the learner should remain in charge and take responsibility for his or her own learning.

## Key Highlights

* Learning environments must emphasize authentic, complex, and project-based learning closely tied to real-world contexts, fostering learner ownership, and promoting reflection and metacognition.
* Instructional design must adhere to constructivist principles, where learners actively construct knowledge and meaning from experiences, and avoid decontextualized information, while recognizing that constructivism is best applied contextually and for advanced knowledge acquisition.
* The apprenticeship model shall be adopted for instruction, fostering self-regulated learning and explicitly embedding 'learning to learn' skills directly into domain-specific contexts, supported by robust, continuous professional development for teachers.
* Educational technology shall act as a mediator and toolkit, supporting advanced knowledge acquisition by promoting active, social interaction and being open, flexible, and adaptive, rather than using 'full' and 'closed' systems.
* Assessment must align with learning goals by evaluating higher-order thinking, knowledge construction, and transfer in authentic contexts, requiring new evaluation assumptions fundamentally different from conventional, objectivist techniques.
* Educational systems must empower lifelong learners, cultivate strong school-community partnerships, and allocate significant resources (e.g., 10-15% of budget) for continuous professional development and innovation to ensure program success and equitable technology access.
