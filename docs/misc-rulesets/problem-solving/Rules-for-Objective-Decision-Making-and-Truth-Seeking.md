## I. Fundamental Principles & Mindset

*   **Embrace Uncertainty:**
    *   Embrace and explicitly express uncertainty, recognizing "I don't know" or "I'm not sure" as acceptable and valuable states.
    *   Focus on estimating probabilities and degrees of uncertainty rather than striving for absolute (0% or 100%) certainty.
    *   Recognize that outcomes rarely have single causes, are rarely 100% due to luck or skill, and future certainty is unattainable.
    *   Reframe the goal from "being right every time" to "calibrating beliefs" towards objective accuracy.
*   **Frame Decisions as Bets:**
    *   Frame all decisions explicitly as "bets," acknowledging inherent risk and uncertainty.
    *   Derive satisfaction from accurately assessing probabilities and executing the best possible "bet," rather than solely from the outcome itself.

## II. Decision Evaluation & Belief Calibration

*   **Evaluate Process, Not Solely Outcome:**
    *   Evaluate decision quality based on the process, alternatives considered, and resources allocated, rather than solely on the outcome.
    *   Actively separate luck from skill and signal from noise when learning from results.
    *   Resist the temptation to change strategy or deem decisions "right" or "wrong" based solely on short-term or single outcomes (avoid "resulting").
    *   Do not assume outcomes directly indicate fault, credit, or decision quality.
*   **Continuously Calibrate Beliefs:**
    *   Actively use outcomes to examine and refine beliefs, modifying them along a spectrum of certainty when new information arises, avoiding binary confirmation or reversal.
    *   Alter beliefs to fit new information, rather than altering interpretation of information to fit existing beliefs.
    *   Vet beliefs before forming them and use all available objective evidence to refine them.
*   **Anticipate Outcomes & Prepare:**
    *   Anticipate a range of outcomes, including potential negative ones, and prepare for their likelihood and emotional impact in advance to prevent unproductive regret or undeserved euphoria.
    *   Make peace with potential bad outcomes in advance by devising response plans.

## III. Mitigating Cognitive Biases & Self-Correction

*   **Actively Combat Biases:**
    *   Identify and actively mitigate common cognitive biases, including confirmation bias (e.g., cherry-picking data, ignoring contradictory information), hindsight bias (e.g., seeing past events as inevitable, disregarding unmaterialized possibilities), and attribution bias (e.g., excessively blaming bad outcomes on luck, taking undue credit for good outcomes).
    *   Avoid binary thinking (e.g., 0% or 100% certainty, black-and-white judgments) and assuming causation when only correlation exists.
    *   Do not make definitive conclusions or predictions based on incomplete information.
    *   Resist the tendency to magnify the present moment or overreact to short-term fluctuations.
*   **Control Emotional Decisions ("Tilt"):**
    *   Recognize and avoid making reactive, emotional decisions when "on tilt" or in an emotionally unfit state.
    *   Precommit to disengage from situations, create physical or mental space, and regain perspective when experiencing signs of "tilt" until emotional clarity is restored.
*   **Cultivate Self-Management Habits:**
    *   Cultivate habits of objective truth-seeking, accurate self-critique, and admitting personal errors, finding satisfaction in these practices rather than seeking credit or avoiding blame.
    *   Leverage natural brain tendencies (e.g., seeking positive self-image, competition) by shifting the reward mechanism to value truth-seeking, giving credit, and admitting mistakes.
    *   Deliberately practice probabilistic thinking and 'bet' framing until they become automatic habits.
    *   Explore alternative hypotheses and seriously opposing viewpoints, using perspective-taking (e.g., imagining outcomes from others' viewpoints, evaluating personal successes as if they happened to someone else) to find balanced truth.
    *   Adopt a long-term view to foster rational thinking and counteract present-moment magnification.
*   **Utilize Mental Time Travel:**
    *   Actively engage in "mental time travel" by considering the perspectives of your past and future selves to inform present decisions and reduce irrationality.
    *   Employ techniques like "pre-regret" (proactively experiencing regret to influence a better choice) and the "10-10-10 rule" (evaluating consequences in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years).
    *   Develop "decision interrupts" as habit routines to prompt this perspective-taking and gain broader context.
*   **Implement Ulysses Contracts:**
    *   Utilize precommitments (Ulysses contracts) to trigger deliberate thought before acting on impulses, especially when susceptibility to irrationality is identified.
    *   Implement small procedural hurdles or remove easy access to temptations to interrupt impulsive behaviors.

## IV. Strategic Planning & Foresight

*   **Conduct Scenario Planning:**
    *   Perform "reconnaissance on the future" by identifying and estimating probabilities for a full range of possible future scenarios, avoiding 0% or 100% certainty assumptions.
    *   Plan as far into the future as possible, considering strategic responses deep into the decision tree to increase adaptability.
    *   Memorialize all possible futures and probabilities considered to counteract resulting and hindsight bias.
*   **Employ Backcasting & Premortems:**
    *   Use "backcasting" by imagining a desired positive outcome has already occurred, then working backward to identify the events, decisions, and factors that led to it.
    *   Complement backcasting with "premortems," where you imagine a future failure and proactively identify all potential reasons for that failure.
    *   In a premortem, embrace the role of a "productive heckler" (not a cheerleader), focusing on creative, relevant, and actionable reasons for failure to uncover obstacles and encourage dissent.
    *   Utilize both techniques together for a complete and balanced view of future scenarios (positive and negative space) and to institutionalize organized skepticism.

## V. Collaborative Truth-Seeking & Group Dynamics

*   **Form Truth-Seeking Groups:**
    *   Form truth-seeking groups with an explicit, unambiguously communicated charter emphasizing accuracy, objectivity, open-mindedness, and accountability (minimum of three members recommended for stability and productivity).
    *   Ensure mutual agreement for direct, challenging feedback ("Lettermanning") within the group, with a modified social contract that prioritizes open-mindedness, giving credit, and taking responsibility.
    *   Focus group discussions on controllable elements, decision improvement, and strategic decisions, rather than complaining about luck or others' poor performance.
    *   Actively cultivate and prioritize diversity of viewpoints and tolerance for dissent within groups to combat echo chambers, confirmation bias, and motivated reasoning.
    *   Reward accuracy and intellectual honesty, and provide feedback when members act against the truth-seeking charter.
*   **Adhere to Mertonian CUDOS Norms:**
    *   **Communism:** Share all conceivably relevant information within the group, defining relevance broadly and proactively offering uncomfortable or clarifying details about one's reasoning. Do not rely on single individual accounts; query members for maximum detail and use structured templates to prevent biased storytelling.
    *   **Universalism:** Apply uniform standards to evaluate information, ideas, and claims based on their merit, independent of their source. Actively consume diverse viewpoints and practice source-agnostic evaluation (e.g., imagining messages from different sources) to cultivate open-mindedness and mitigate bias.
    *   **Disinterestedness:** Maintain vigilance against potential conflicts of interest. To prevent outcome bias, conduct outcome-blind evaluations and deconstruct decisions *before* outcomes are known. Conceal personal opinions or desired outcomes from the group to prevent ideological conflicts of interest. Reward objective consideration of alternative hypotheses and skillful debate of opposing viewpoints over defending pre-existing positions.
    *   **Organized Skepticism:** Systematically approach information with skepticism, actively seeking flaws and reasons why it might not be true, especially for information confirming existing beliefs. Encourage engagement and dissent within the group, establishing "devil's advocate" or "red team" roles. When dissenting, use softer, inquiry-based phrasing (e.g., "I'm not sure," "Have you considered?") to promote constructive dialogue.
*   **Respect Social Context:**
    *   Outside of dedicated truth-seeking groups, generally observe prevailing social contracts and do not expect everyone to adopt or engage in truth-seeking communication.
    *   Allow temporary "opting out" for emotional off-loading in truth-seeking groups, provided it is recognized as an exception and followed by a return to objective analysis.

## VI. Effective Communication

*   **Express Confidence Probabilistically:**
    *   Express confidence and beliefs as degrees or percentages (e.g., on a 0-100% scale or range), acknowledging the probabilistic nature of all beliefs.
    *   Declare your level of uncertainty when communicating to others to prevent all-or-nothing thinking or passive adoption of your beliefs.
    *   Avoid all-or-nothing expressions of confidence (e.g., "I'm confident," "I'm not confident," or absolutes like "always," "never," "100%").
*   **Communicate Constructively:**
    *   When engaging with disagreement, start by identifying and explicitly stating points of agreement, then connect with "and" rather than "but."
    *   When others express strong emotions, explicitly ask if they seek to vent or receive advice to establish a temporary truth-seeking agreement.
    *   Focus discussions on future actions and improvements, rather than rehashing past events or dwelling on blame.
    *   When discussing past decisions, especially successful ones, actively identify self-identified mistakes or areas for improvement rather than simply seeking affirmation.
*   **Mind Your Language ("Decision Swear Jar"):**
    *   Actively avoid language patterns that signal an illusion of certainty, overconfidence, irrational outcome attribution (e.g., blaming all bad outcomes on luck, taking all credit for good outcomes), complaining solely for sympathy, insulting others, violating universalism (e.g., disparaging messages due to messenger), magnifying the present moment, explicit motivated reasoning, or hiding relevant facts.
    *   Recognize the use of such "trigger" phrases as a breach of truth-seeking commitment and a signal of bias, prompting a "stop-and-think" decision-interrupt.

## VII. Professional & Technical Practices

*   **Organizational Principles:**
    *   Implement formal and anonymous dissent channels (e.g., "red teams") that actively reward constructive dissent and seriously consider suggestions.
    *   Prioritize diversity of viewpoint and tolerance for dissent in group formation, hiring, and all decision groups, implementing an anti-discrimination policy against opposing viewpoints.
    *   Define organizational "winning" to include accurate, objective, and detailed evaluation to foster a culture of continuous learning.
    *   Evaluate strategies and processes *before* outcomes are known (e.g., trial strategy before verdict) to reduce outcome bias and resulting.
    *   Integrate likelihood estimation and expected value into all planning and prioritization, continuously improving probability estimates.
    *   Conduct post-outcome reviews (for both successes and failures) to understand contributing factors (luck/skill), improve probability estimates, and refine future actions.
    *   Institutionalize scenario planning and precommitments (Ulysses contracts) across departments to embed rational decision-making and counter emotional impulses.
*   **Scientific Method Adherence:**
    *   Institutionalize the expression of uncertainty and focus on advancing knowledge over affirming existing beliefs.
    *   Ensure full and open communication of research data to the community, requiring access to detailed experimental design/methods for proper review.
    *   Actively counteract outcome and confirmation biases in data analysis and review processes.
*   **Data & Calculation:**
    *   Government data must be shared with the public.
    *   Calculate expected value by multiplying the probability of each possible outcome by its likelihood and summing these products.
    *   Be efficient and respect time constraints in decision-making contexts.
    *   Strategically weigh low-probability, high-impact risks against increased opportunities for success.

## Key Highlights

* Embrace and explicitly express uncertainty, estimating probabilities rather than striving for absolute certainty, and frame all decisions as "bets" acknowledging inherent risk.
* Evaluate decision quality based on the process, alternatives considered, and resources allocated, actively separating luck from skill, and resisting changes based solely on short-term outcomes.
* Continuously calibrate beliefs by altering them to fit new information, and actively combat cognitive biases such as confirmation, hindsight, and attribution bias, avoiding binary thinking.
* Recognize and avoid making reactive, emotional decisions, and cultivate habits of objective truth-seeking, accurate self-critique, and admitting personal errors.
* Utilize scenario planning, backcasting (imagining success and working backward), and premortems (proactively identifying reasons for failure) for comprehensive foresight and to institutionalize skepticism.
* Form truth-seeking groups with an explicit charter for accuracy, open-mindedness, and direct feedback, cultivating diversity of viewpoints and tolerance for dissent.
* Adhere to Mertonian CUDOS norms: share all relevant information, apply uniform standards, guard against conflicts of interest, and systematically seek flaws in all information.
* Express confidence and beliefs probabilistically, declaring your level of uncertainty when communicating, and focus discussions on future actions and improvements rather than blame.

## Insightful Ideas

* Develop a mandatory training program focused on probabilistic thinking, framing decisions as bets, and active cognitive bias mitigation for all decision-makers.
* Establish structured 'Truth-Seeking Groups' for critical projects or high-stakes decisions, explicitly chartering them with Mertonian CUDOS norms.
* Integrate 'Premortem' and 'Scenario Planning' exercises as a standard practice during the initiation phase for all new high-impact initiatives.
* Design and implement a 'Decision Quality Review Checklist' to evaluate decision processes after outcomes are known, explicitly separating luck from skill and signal from noise.
