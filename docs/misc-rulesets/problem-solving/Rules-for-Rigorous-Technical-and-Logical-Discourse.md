### I. Fundamental Principles of Logical Discourse

1.  **Eliminate Inconsistencies:** Eliminate all inconsistencies and self-contradictions as a prerequisite for genuine inquiry into possibility, impossibility, or necessity. Rule out self-contradictory statements and conclusions inconsistent with available data at the outset.
2.  **Maintain Coherence:** Ensure consistency and coherence for rational assessment; accept all propositions entailed by your data.
3.  **Embrace Contextual Relevance:**
    *   Apply warrants, backing, and criteria relevant to the specific problem type; never apply analytic criteria indiscriminately across all fields of argument.
    *   Do not consider the absence of entailments in substantial arguments a sign of weakness.
    *   Replace mathematically idealized, timeless, context-free logical relations with context-dependent relations to achieve an applicable and lifelike logic.
    *   Recognize that logic, when applied, cannot be a completely pure and formal discipline without losing its essential character.
4.  **Acknowledge Conceptual Dynamics:**
    *   Respect or proactively resolve to remove self-imposed logical constraints.
    *   Acknowledge any particular set of logical necessities and impossibilities only as long as concepts or calculi remain unmodified; any change will fundamentally alter conditions of consistency and intelligibility.
5.  **Uphold Non-Contradiction:** Do not demand proof or backing for the law of non-contradiction; instead, challenge critics to produce meaningful objections.

### II. Argument Construction & Formal Validity

1.  **Structure Arguments Properly:**
    *   Set out arguments in a proper, consistent, and coherent form before assessing their merits.
    *   Arguments are formally adequate if expressed either as `Data` (D) → `Conclusion` (C) authorized by a `Warrant` (W) (where W acts as a substitution-rule), or as a mathematical argument from an appropriate calculus.
    *   To achieve formal validity, express arguments in the 'Data; Warrant; so Conclusion' (D; W; C) form, not 'Data; Backing; so Conclusion' (D; B; C).
    *   Phrase arguments to make their validity apparent simply from their form.
2.  **Establish Warrants:**
    *   A warrant (W) must be established for an argument to be valid.
    *   Every moral argument depends for its soundness upon an appropriate warrant.
    *   For analytic syllogisms, assume one premise provides sufficient warrant; do not seek additional general warrants.
3.  **Formulate Impossibility Statements Clearly:** When expressing an impossibility, clearly state the grounds (P), the prohibited action (Q), the offense (R), and the penalties (S), following the pattern: ‘P being what it is, you must rule out anything involving Q: to do otherwise would be R, and would invite S.”
4.  **Use Modalities Precisely:**
    *   When a substantial argument yields an unequivocal conclusion, use "D, so necessarily C."
    *   When an analytic argument yields a tentative conclusion, state that it follows "analytically," not "necessarily."

### III. Precision in Terminology & Definition

1.  **Ensure Intelligible Terminology:**
    *   Do not use terms that render communication unintelligible (e.g., "male sister").
    *   Avoid misleading or perplexing names for theories, calculi, or activities; titles are earned by fulfilling implied conditions and purposes, not freely chosen.
    *   Reconsider a calculus's title if it becomes pure mathematics divorced from its original application.
    *   Be cautious before allowing any formal calculus to assume the title of "logic," acknowledging that symbolic logic is a part, but not the entirety, of logic.
2.  **Employ Specific Terminology:**
    *   Prefer "support-relations" over "probability-relations" for clarity in discussions of evidence bearing on hypotheses.
    *   Only refer to support-relations as "probabilities" when they measure the degree of probability allotted to a hypothesis based on total available evidence.
    *   A calculus must be suitable for estimating probabilities (degrees of trust/belief) to be named a "probability-calculus."
    *   Do not treat the abstract noun "probability" as denoting a tangible counterpart, nor assume a single, universal subject matter for all probability statements.
    *   Properly use "deduction" for arguments applying established warrants or set computational procedures to reach a conclusion.
3.  **Avoid Conflation:**
    *   Renounce the interchangeable use of "necessarily" and "deductively" (when the latter means "analytically"). Consider replacing "deductively" and "necessarily" with "analytically" or "unequivocally" for greater precision.
    *   Carefully avoid confusing or conflating distinct logical distinctions.
    *   Distinguish between linguistic corrections (usage) and fundamental objections (to the activity itself).
4.  **Address Ambiguity:**
    *   Do not be deceived by superficial similarities of expression.
    *   Look for ambiguities in small but key words.
    *   Take care to counter ambiguities in tricky phrases (e.g., "say more than") to avoid trouble in logical questions.

### IV. Argument Assessment & Critique Standards

1.  **Judge Contextually:**
    *   Do not judge claims (knowledge, probability) "outside time" or *sub specie aeternitatis*; context and circumstances of judgment and utterance are paramount.
    *   Assess inductive reasoning by inductive standards and scientific reasoning by scientific standards.
    *   Judge predictive arguments by fresh standards once the predicted event has occurred, and do not assess them as mistaken until the event occurs.
2.  **Identify and Apply Analytic Arguments Correctly:**
    *   Class an argument as analytic if and only if verifying the warrant's backing intrinsically verifies or falsifies the conclusion.
    *   Identify analytic arguments by examining the problem's nature and the warrant's establishment, not by keyword presence (e.g., "all," "some").
    *   In analytic arguments, one is entitled to look for entailments between data, backing, and conclusion.
    *   Treat analytic arguments as special cases; do not generalize their characteristics or accept them as a universal paradigm for all reasoning.
    *   Reserve "deductive" standards for arguments explicitly intended to be analytic, necessary, and formally valid.
3.  **Critique Substantial Arguments Appropriately:**
    *   Do not look for entailments in substantial arguments, nor be disappointed if they are absent.
    *   Do not apply analytic criteria (e.g., entailment) when assessing the real merits of any substantial argument.
    *   Do not view the failure of a predictive argument to match analytic standards as a shortcoming.
4.  **Acknowledge Rational Competence:** If someone fails to follow an analytic step after explanation, attribute it to a lack of basic rational competence, not linguistic incompetence.
5.  **Utilize Diverse Critical Modes:** Do not neglect the distinct modes of criticism for arguments (e.g., warrants vs. rebuttals).
6.  **Avoid Mischaracterizing Necessity:**
    *   Do not claim that logical and systematic necessities are "stronger" or "more ineluctable" than practical (e.g., physical, moral) necessities, nor use language like "ineluctable" or "insuperable" for them.
    *   Do not discuss the "strength" or "weakness" of logical necessities.
    *   Do not equate mathematical impossibilities with practical misfortunes or treat them with similar emotional gravity.

### V. Claims to Knowledge & Justification

1.  **Require Explicit Grounds:**
    *   Justify any claim that a possibility must be ruled out with explicit grounds or reasons.
    *   Ensure a suggestion "has what it takes" to be entitled to genuine consideration before deeming it a "possibility."
2.  **Base Arguments on Complete Information:** Base arguments on all relevant information, especially when complete backing is available; do not rely solely on partial data (e.g., bare percentages).
3.  **Fulfill Knowledge Claim Requirements:**
    *   To make a proper claim of knowledge: ensure sufficient experience in the relevant domain; ensure all reasonable observations and tests have been performed; ensure the judgment based on observations is reasonably considered.
    *   To make a proper probabilistic claim: ensure records are sufficiently comprehensive and reliable; ensure data about the subject is complete and correct; ensure computation is error-free.
4.  **Manage Predictive Evidence:** Do not include eye-witness accounts of an event among the evidence for a prediction *before* the event occurs. A clearly falsified prediction means the original assertion was mistaken.
5.  **Maintain Accountability:**
    *   Understand that "I know so-and-so" implies a commitment to one's assertion and answerability for its reliability, while "He knows" claims authority for another person, staking one's own reputation on their opinion's reliability.
    *   Each person must justify their own assertions.
    *   For logical questions of "how we know", one must produce grounds (evidence, proof, justification). A claim to knowledge lays one open to challenge and requires justification.
    *   If one has reasons to doubt a person's reliability, it is proper to say "He believes..." rather than "He knows...", even if the person claims to know.
    *   If conjecturing about someone's grounds for an assertion, ask "Why does he believe that...?" rather than "How does he know that...?".
    *   Recognize that questions like "How do you know?" or "How does he know?" aim to elicit grounds, qualifications, or credentials, not to reveal hidden cognitive mechanisms; such questions almost always require a biographical answer.
6.  **Act Consistently:** Avoid inconsistency between stating a possibility and acting upon it. Do not indefinitely ignore a stated possibility without good reason.
7.  **Critique Claims Effectively:** When attacking a claim to knowledge, critique the argument's backing or the claimant's qualifications, not solely the conclusion's truth.

### VI. Scope and Limitations of Formal Methods

1.  **Respect Formalization Limits:**
    *   Exclude mathematically impossible notions from subsequent mathematical arguments.
    *   Mathematical logic, when applied to practical conclusions, can concern itself *solely* with questions of internal consistency.
    *   Not all sentences can be turned into mathematical theorems; only notions systematically articulated in a near-mathematical way (e.g., "draw," "heat") are suitable starting points for calculi.
    *   Ethical and aesthetic problems are not formulated more effectively by being made the subject for a calculus. Value judgments cannot be discussed in purely mathematical terms.
2.  **Ensure Practical Application:**
    *   When applying a calculus, ensure only expressions with serious practical interpretations are relevant.
    *   Mathematical calculations cease to be part of physics if divorced from all possible experimental application.
    *   Recognize that requirements for calculi change as soon as they are put to work in practical arguments.
    *   "Logical" criteria of possibility, impossibility, and necessity are not sufficient to demonstrate genuine practical possibility, impossibility, or necessity in substantial arguments. Practical questions about possibility, impossibility, or necessity require consideration beyond mere consistency, intelligibility, or meaningfulness.
3.  **Understand Formal to Practical Necessity Relationship:**
    *   Systematic necessities and impossibilities of formal calculi can only re-express necessities and impossibilities of other kinds; they do not impose new ones. Formal necessities cannot genuinely reinforce the necessities of practical life.
    *   Practical necessities lend their strength to systematic necessities, not the other way around.
4.  **Uphold Philosophical Integrity:**
    *   Do not insist on treating logical relations mathematically in applied logic, as this inevitably misrepresents them and leads to divergence between applied and theoretical logic.
    *   Retain no illusions about the true extent of symbolic logic's relevance to practical arguments.
    *   Do not operate with an oversimple picture of the senses and the intellect.
    *   Avoid the "trap-question" of how one "sees" necessity with an "Inner Eye" when discussing the need to conform to rules.

## Key Highlights

* All inconsistencies and self-contradictions must be eliminated as a prerequisite for genuine inquiry into possibility, impossibility, or necessity.
* Apply warrants and criteria relevant to the specific problem type, recognizing that logic, when applied, must be context-dependent rather than timeless and pure.
* Arguments must be set out in a proper, consistent, and coherent form, with established warrants for validity, to make their logic apparent.
* Carefully avoid confusing or conflating distinct logical distinctions, look for ambiguities in key words, and use specific terminology to enhance clarity in discourse.
* Judge arguments contextually by applying standards appropriate to their type, and treat analytic arguments as special cases rather than a universal paradigm for all reasoning.
* A claim to knowledge implies a commitment to one's assertion and answerability for its reliability, demanding explicit grounds, evidence, or proof for one's assertions.
* Recognize that not all problems, especially ethical and aesthetic ones, are effectively formulated as calculi, and formal logical criteria are insufficient to demonstrate genuine practical possibility or necessity.

## Insightful Ideas

* Develop a standardized review checklist or rubric derived from these principles, specifically for assessing technical documents, presentations, and arguments, to ensure consistent application of logical rigor.
* Design and conduct internal training sessions or workshops for technical teams to ensure comprehensive understanding and practical application of these nuanced principles in their daily work.
* Integrate key principles, particularly those related to terminology and argument structure, into existing organizational documentation and communication guidelines to foster a consistent and precise technical discourse culture.
* Establish a feedback mechanism or review process to identify common violations of these principles in ongoing technical work, and proactively address recurring logical fallacies or communication ambiguities.
