# Rules for Experimental Physics Data Analysis and Statistical Inference

NOTES: All uncertainties are typically reported at 1 standard deviation (68.3% confidence level) unless otherwise stated. Angles in uncertainty calculations must be in radians. Greek letters ($\mu, \sigma, \rho$) denote parent population parameters, while Latin letters ($\bar{x}, s, r$) denote experimental estimates. Summation over $i=1$ to $N$ can be abbreviated as $\sum$.

## I. Assumptions, Domains of Validity & Prohibitions

1. **Uncertainty Ascription:** Assume all uncertainty in each measurement belongs to the dependent variable, provided the uncertainty in the dependent variable due to variations in the independent variable is much smaller than its direct uncertainty (i.e., $\sigma_x (dy/dx) \ll \sigma_y$).
2. **Approximation for Most Probable Value:** Assume the most probable value for a dependent variable $x$ is given by $x = f(u, v, \ldots)$.
3. **Computer Calculation of Uncertainties (Prohibition):** Do not incorporate all variations into a single equation (e.g., `DX = CALCULATE(U + DU, V + DV, W + DW, ... ) - X`), as this incorrectly implies known errors rather than independent, estimated variations.
4. **Data Discarding (Chauvenet's Criterion):** Discard a data point if the expectation is less than half an event to be farther from the mean than the suspect point. Do not perform repeated point deletion.
5. **Data Extraction from Small Bins (Prohibition):** Do not attempt to extract information from data by sorting in bins that are smaller than the uncertainties in the measurements.
6. **Low-Count Binning (Prohibition):** Do not use bin widths so narrow that the number of events in the bins are too small to satisfy Gaussian statistics (e.g., mean $\mu < 10$). Merge low-count bins for $\chi^2$ calculations.
7. **Fitting Assumption (Optimality):** The fitting procedure may not yield optimum results if the data are fit with an incorrect fitting function or with uncertainties that do not follow the Gaussian distribution.
8. **Least-Squares Limitations (Function Linearity):** Restrict the least-squares method and multiple regression to fitting functions that are linear in the parameters, as defined by $y(x) = \sum_{k=1}^m a_k f_k(x)$.
9. **Least-Squares with Poisson Data (Analytical Solutions):** It is not possible to derive a set of independent linear equations for parameters when using errors determined from the parent distribution or direct Poisson statistics.
10. **Minimal Information from Small Data Sets:** Do not expect to extract more than minimal information from a very small data set.
11. **Nonlinear Fitting (Parameter Bounds):** If necessary, place limits on parameters in the search procedure to keep them within physically allowable ranges. Ensure the final value of any parameter is not at these artificially imposed limits.
12. **Nonlinear Fitting (Initial Step Size):** Avoid very small step sizes, as they result in slow convergence. Avoid step sizes that are too large, as they will overshoot local minima.
13. **Nonlinear Fitting (Local Minima):** Be aware of the existence of multiple solutions or local minima in nonlinear fitting. A poor choice of starting point may drive the solution to a local minimum instead of the absolute minimum.
14. **Nonlinear Fitting (Parabolic Approximation Validity):** The parabolic approximation of the $\chi^2$ hypersurface is not valid if the starting point is too far from the minimum, leading to erroneous results. If the curvature of $\chi^2$ is negative, the solution will tend toward a maximum.
15. **Orthogonal Polynomials (Applicability):** This method is suitable for data where independent variables ($x_i$) are equally spaced and uncertainties ($\sigma_i$) are constant.
16. **Poisson Distribution (Domain of Validity):** Use the Poisson distribution for small values of the mean (e.g., $\mu \leq 16$) and integral values of the argument ($x$). For larger $\mu$, the Gaussian distribution can be used as an approximation.
17. **Probability Interpretation (Chi-Square):** If the $\chi^2/\nu$ value is large (low probability), conclude that data sets were drawn from different distributions. Do not conclude data sets were drawn from the same distribution if $\chi^2/\nu$ is low (high probability), as different but similar distributions might exist.
18. **Random Number Generator (Verification):** Always check random number distributions for correlations and ensure the function behaves as advertised.
19. **Smoothing (Side Effects):** Recognize that smoothing will reduce the $\chi^2$ value at the minimum and thus the bias in area estimation, but there is no overall gain in information, and improvement in area must be offset by increased uncertainty in other parameters (e.g., peak width, position).
20. **Systematic Errors (Prohibition):** Do not consider results extremely accurate if precision is low due to systematic errors.
21. **Uncertainty Increase (Prohibition):** Resist the temptation to increase error estimates "just to be sure."
22. **Uncertainty Propagation (Covariance Term Neglect):** Neglect covariant terms in the error propagation equation if fluctuations in measured quantities are uncorrelated.
23. **Gaussian Statistics for Uncertainties:** When calculating uncertainties in parameters, generally assume Gaussian statistics (Eq. 11.51).
24. **F-Probability Approximation Validity:** The approximation `P_F(1/F_12; v2, v1) = P_F(F_12; v1, v2)` is valid only for reasonably large degrees of freedom (`v1` and `v2`).
25. **Sample Variances as Range Measures:** Sample variances `s_j^2` measure ranges of variation of variables, not uncertainties in the variables (Eq. 11.23).
26. **Gaussian Width and Fit Validity:** If the original Gaussian distribution width `sigma` is very small (`sigma < 1`), a Gaussian fit to the data without smoothing would not be valid, as parameters are only meaningful if `sigma = 1`. The binomial approximation `y(x) = (1/sqrt(2pi)sigma) * exp[-(x-mu)^2 / 2sigma^2]` is also invalid under this condition.
27. **Reduced Chi-Squared Anomaly:** A very small reduced chi-squared value (e.g., $\chi_\nu^2 < 1$) may indicate an error in the assignment of uncertainties in the measured variables.

### II. Boundary & Initial Conditions

1. **Chi-Square Test (Minimum Measurements):** For a linear fit with two parameters (A and B), at least three measurements ($N=3$) must be made before a $\chi^2$ test can be applied.
2. **Fitting Nonlinear Functions (Starting Values):** Determine starting values for parameters before applying nonlinear fitting methods.
3. **Monte Carlo (Random Number Seeds):** For multiple Monte Carlo runs, record the last values of the seeds at the end of each run and use them as starting seeds for the next run to assure statistical independence.
4. **Poisson Distribution (Non-Negative Values):** The Poisson distribution $P_P(x; \mu)$ is not defined for negative values of $x$. It does not become 0 for $x = 0$.
5. **Rejection Method (Probability Distribution):** The probability distribution used in the rejection method must be positive and well behaved within its allowed range.
6. **Normalization Integral Limits (Special Cases):**
    * If the lower cutoff time `t_1 = 0` and upper cutoff time `t_2 = infinity` for a normalization integral (Eq. 10.5), then the normalizing factor `A_i = 1/T`.
    * If the lower cutoff time is `t_min` and upper cutoff time `t_2 = infinity`, then `A_i = 1 / (T * e^(-t_min/T))`.
7. **Multi-Step Fitting Parameter Freezing:** In multi-step fitting procedures (e.g., Example 9.1), parameters obtained in earlier steps (e.g., `a_1` through `a_3` for background) may be fixed in subsequent steps when fitting other parameters.
8. **Multi-Step Fitting Starting Values:** Starting values for all parameters in a multi-step fitting process should be initialized based on results obtained in preceding steps.
9. **Likelihood Function Calculation (Event-wise):** The likelihood function's value (`M = ln L`) must be calculated separately for each event and for every trial value of the parameter `T`.
10. **Asymmetrical Uncertainty Reporting:** For asymmetrical likelihood distributions, estimate and report two standard deviations (e.g., `tau +/- sigma_1 / sigma_2`) by analyzing regions on each side of the mean separately.

### III. Constitutive Relations & Specific Models

1. **Binomial Distribution Mean:** $\mu = np$.
2. **Binomial Distribution Variance:** $\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$.
3. **Error Transformation (Function of Measured Quantity):** If fitting a function $f(y)$ rather than $y$, the uncertainties $\sigma_i$ in measured quantities must be modified by $\sigma'_i = \sigma_i |\frac{df}{dy_i}|$.
4. **Error Transformation (Function of Parameters):** If a modified coefficient $a' = f_a(a)$, the estimated error in $a$ is $\sigma_a = \sigma_{a'} (\frac{da}{da'}) = \sigma_{a'} / (\frac{df_a(a)}{da})$.
5. **Gaussian Deviate (Smearing Data):** When simulating measuring uncertainties, use $T' = T + \sigma z$, where $z$ is a random variable from the standard Gaussian distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1).
6. **Gaussian Half-Width:** $\Gamma = 2.354 \sigma$.
7. **Gaussian Probable Error:** $PE = 0.6745 \sigma$.
8. **Lorentzian Distribution (No Standard Deviation):** The standard deviation is not defined for the Lorentzian distribution; its integral is unbounded.
9. **Poisson Distribution Mean:** The mean $\mu$ is the parameter $\mu$ in the probability function.
10. **Poisson Distribution Standard Deviation:** $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu}$.
11. **Poisson Distribution Variance:** $\sigma^2 = \mu$.
12. **Weighted Mean:** The weighted mean $\mu'$ is given by $\mu' = \frac{\sum (x_i/\sigma_i^2)}{\sum (1/\sigma_i^2)}$ (Eq. 4.17).
13. **Variance of Weighted Mean:** The variance of the weighted mean $\sigma_{\mu'}^2 = \frac{1}{\sum (1/\sigma_i^2)}$ (Eq. 4.19).
14. **Background Polynomial:** The background polynomial is defined as `y_b(x) = a_1 + a_2E + a_3E^2`.
15. **Generalized Fitting Function (Multiple Peaks):** `Y(E) = a_0 + a_1E + a_2E^2 + A_peak1 * (Gamma1/(2pi)) / ((E-E01)^2 + (Gamma1/2)^2) + A_peak2 * (Gamma2/(2pi)) / ((E-E02)^2 + (Gamma2/2)^2)` (Eq. 9.13).
16. **Background Subtraction:** The peak function is defined as `y_p(x) = y(x) - y_b(x)`.
17. **General Polynomial Fitting Function:** `y(x) = sum(a_j * f_j(x))` (Eq. 11.44).
18. **Straight-Line Model:** `y = a + bx` (Eq. 11.11).
19. **Inverse Straight-Line Model:** `x = a' + b'y` (Eq. 11.13).
20. **Legendre Polynomial Recursion Relation:** $P_L(x) = \frac{1}{L} [(2L-1)x P_{L-1}(x) - (L-1) P_{L-2}(x)]$.

### IV. Measurement, Operational Definitions & Protocols

1. **Accuracy Definition:** Accuracy is a measure of how close the result of an experiment is to the true value.
2. **Precision Definitions:**
    * **Precision:** A measure of how well the result has been determined (reproducibility), without reference to its agreement with the true value.
    * **Absolute Precision:** Indicates the magnitude of the uncertainty in the result in the same units as the result.
    * **Relative Precision:** Indicates the uncertainty in terms of a fraction of the value of the result.
    * **Digital Instrument Precision:** Cannot be better than half the last digit on the display.
3. **Error Definition:** Error is the difference between an observed or calculated value and the true value.
4. **Uncertainty Definition:** Uncertainty is the magnitude of error that is estimated to have been made in the determination of results.
5. **Estimating Uncertainty (Confidence Level):** Set a confidence level that a repeated measurement will fall this close to the mean or closer; often use the standard deviation (68% confidence level).
6. **Instrumental Uncertainty Estimation:** Estimate instrumental uncertainties by examining instruments and considering the measuring procedure.
7. **Measurement Readings:** Attempt to make readings to a fraction of the smallest scale division on the instrument (e.g., half or fifth of a division).
8. **Significant Figures:**
    * The leftmost nonzero digit is the most significant digit.
    * All digits between the least and most significant digits are counted as significant digits.
    * If there is no decimal point, the rightmost nonzero digit is the least significant digit.
    * If there is a decimal point, the rightmost digit is the least significant digit, even if it is 0.
    * To avoid ambiguity when the rightmost digit is 0 and there is no decimal point, supply decimal points or write numbers in scientific notation.
    * The number of significant figures in a result should be approximately one more than that dictated by the experimental precision to avoid rounding errors in later calculations.
9. **Rounding Off:**
    * **Fraction > 1/2:** If the decimal fraction of dropped digits is greater than 1/2, increment the new least significant digit.
    * **Fraction < 1/2:** If the decimal fraction of dropped digits is less than 1/2, do not increment the new least significant digit.
    * **Fraction = 1/2:** If the decimal fraction of dropped digits equals 1/2, increment the least significant digit only if it is odd.
    * **Intermediate Calculations:** Retain all available digits in intermediate calculations and round only the final results.
10. **Peak Fitting Region:** Fit the peak function `y_p(x)` only in the region of the peak.
11. **Parameter Estimation Regions:** Separate the curve into logical regions (e.g., background, peak, and transition regions) for robust parameter estimation.
12. **Fiducial Region Selection:** Select decay vertices only within the fiducial region to assure precise measurements.
13. **Bias Correction:** Understand and correct for biases introduced by event losses outside the fiducial region.
14. **Efficiency Function Uncertainty:** Ensure statistical uncertainties in the efficiency function determination are negligible compared to statistical and other uncertainties in the actual experiment.
15. **Data Point Exclusion:** Eliminate data points requiring large corrections (due to low efficiency regions) from the sample, as they contribute little and depend heavily on corrections.
16. **Geometric Factors:** Calculate geometric factors to correct for particles decaying outside the detector; these factors depend on parameters and event kinematics.
17. **Fiducial Region Definition:** Determine the minimum (`d_1`) and maximum (`d_2`) distances for each particle to define the fiducial region.
18. **Time of Flight Conversion:** Convert minimum and maximum distances (`d_1`, `d_2`) to times of flight (`t_1`, `t_2`) in the rest frame of the decaying particles.
19. **Confidence Level Probability Siding:**
    * For symmetrical distributions (e.g., Gaussian), consider two-sided probability for confidence level determination.
    * For distributions defined only for positive arguments (e.g., chi-squared, Poisson), find a one-sided probability.

### V. Numerical Methods & Computational Procedures

1. **Numerical Derivative Accuracy:** Choose intervals for numerical derivatives large enough to avoid roundoff errors but small enough to furnish reasonably accurate values of the derivatives near the minimum.
2. **Numerical Integration of Gaussian:** The integral of the Gaussian function must be evaluated numerically (e.g., Taylor series expansion or numerical integration).
3. **Poisson Deviate Generation (Efficiency):** For generating Poisson deviates, precalculate a table of sums of $P_P(i; \mu)$ to improve computational efficiency.
4. **Random Number Generation (Efficient Calculation):** When using the transformation method, precalculate and store tables of repeatedly used solutions or integrals in the initializing section of a Monte Carlo program to reduce computing time.
5. **Random Number Generation (Resolution):** When using precalculated tables, consider the required resolution in the generated variable, as this determines the table size and search time.
6. **Rejection Method (Efficiency):** Place the strictest possible limits on the random coordinates used to map out the distribution function when using the rejection method to improve efficiency.
7. **Rounding Errors (Computer):** Be aware of rounding errors with computers due to finite word length, especially in matrix and determinant calculations involving small differences between large numbers. Use double-precision variables if necessary.
8. **Plotting Fit Results (Bin Displacement):** Always take care when plotting results of a fit that the curve is not displaced half a bin width from the data.
9. **Multi-Step Fitting Protocol:**
    * Fit the background polynomial `y_b(x) = a_1 + a_2E + a_3E^2` simultaneously to regions below and above the peak to obtain provisional values for `a_1` through `a_3`.
    * Fit the entire function (e.g., Eq. 9.1) to the central region, fixing `a_1` through `a_3` (obtained from previous step) to obtain other peak parameters (e.g., `a_4`, `a_5`, and `a_6`).
    * Fit the entire function simultaneously to all regions, setting starting values of all parameters to those obtained in previous steps, to obtain refined values.
    * Repeat the fitting process from the refined steps if parameters continue to change significantly on each iteration.
10. **Complete Function Fitting:** The complete fitting function `y(E)` must be fitted to both peak and background regions, ensuring that tail contributions of the peak are included outside the peak region and background terms are included underneath the peak.
11. **Optimum Bin Sizes:** Select optimum bin sizes for histograms.
12. **Probability Density Conversion:** Convert each event's `y(x_i)` to a normalized probability density function `P_i = P(x_i; a_1, a_2, ..., a_m)` evaluated at the observed `x_i`.
13. **Maximum Likelihood (Logarithm):** To avoid computer underflow when maximizing the likelihood function, maximize the logarithm of the likelihood function `M = ln L` (Eq. 10.7) instead. The logarithm of the likelihood function (`M`) must be a reasonable, negative number.
14. **Grid-Search or Gradient-Search:** If an analytical solution is not possible for maximizing `M(T)`, use a grid-search or gradient-search method.
15. **Search Range Definition:** Set the search range for each parameter (e.g., `TAU`).
16. **Data Input for Fitting:** Read fiducial region limits (`d_1`, `d_2`) and individual event data during data input.
17. **Grid-Search Termination:** Terminate a grid-search when the logarithm of the likelihood function (`M`) stops increasing and starts decreasing.
18. **Grid-Search Refinement:** At termination of a grid-search, fit a parabola to the last three points to refine the maximum estimate of the parameter.
19. **Numerical Second Derivative:** When exact calculation of the second derivative `d^2M/da^2` (for uncertainty estimation) is not possible, use finite differences.
20. **Double-Precision for Integrals:** When numerically integrating chi-squared probability and variable overflow is a problem, use double-precision variables.
21. **Chi-Squared Integral for Specific Degrees of Freedom:**
    * For `v = 1` and `chi^2 < 2`, use a Taylor series expansion and analytical integration for chi-squared probability.
    * For `v = 2`, use the analytic form of the integral for chi-squared probability.
22. **Correlation Coefficient Integral:** Integrate `P(r; N)` (Eq. 11.19) numerically or by series expansion.
23. **F-Table Checking:** When using F-tables, check both `F_12` and `F_21 = 1/F_12` to ensure the test value is not too large or too small, comparing `F_21` to tables with reversed degrees of freedom (Eq. 11.40).
24. **Monte Carlo Program Validation:** Test Monte Carlo programs under a variety of conditions and examine intermediate results for validation. Check and recheck Monte Carlo calculations if results violate intuition.
25. **Gamma Function Approximation:** For computing the gamma function for large arguments, use Stirling's approximation `Gamma(n) = sqrt(2*pi) * e^(-n) * n^(n-1/2) * (1 + 0.0833/n)` (Eq. 11.8) to avoid overflow issues.

### VI. PDE Type, Regularity & Normalization

1. **Binomial Distribution Normalization:** The sum of binomial distribution coefficients $P_B(x; n, p)$ over all possible values of $x$ (from 0 to $n$) must equal 1. (From $(\text{p+q})^n = \sum_{x=0}^n \binom{n}{x} p^x q^{n-x} = 1^n = 1$).
2. **Poisson Distribution Normalization:** The sum of the Poisson probability function $P_P(x; \mu)$ over all allowed values of $x$ must equal unity: $\sum_{x=0}^\infty P_P(x; \mu) = 1$.
3. **Continuous Parent Distribution Normalization:** The probability density function $p(x)$ is normalized to unit area: $\int p(x)dx = 1$.

### VII. Probability & Statistical Inference

1. **Expectation Value Definitions:**
    * **Discrete:** $\langle f(x) \rangle = \sum_{j=1}^n [f(x_j) P(x_j)]$.
    * **Continuous:** $\langle f(x) \rangle = \int f(x) p(x) dx$.
2. **Distribution Definitions:**
    * **Deviation:** The deviation $d_i$ of any measurement $x_i$ from the mean $\mu$ of the parent distribution is defined as $d_i = x_i - \mu$.
    * **Mean of Experimental Distribution:** $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i$.
    * **Mean of Parent Population:** $\mu = \lim_{N \to \infty} (\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i)$.
    * **Median:** The median $\mu_{med}$ is the value for which half the observations will be less than $\mu_{med}$ and half will be greater (i.e., $P(x_i < \mu_{med}) = P(x_i > \mu_{med}) = 1/2$).
    * **Mode:** The mode $\mu_{mode}$ is that value for which the parent distribution has the greatest value.
    * **Average Deviation:** $\alpha = \lim_{N \to \infty} (\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N |x_i - \mu|)$.
    * **Variance:** $\sigma^2 = \lim_{N \to \infty} (\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2)$.
    * **Standard Deviation:** $\sigma$ is the square root of the variance.
    * **Variance of Sample Population:** $s^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2$.
3. **Likelihood Function & Maximization:**
    * The likelihood function `L(a_1, a_2, ..., a_m)` is the product of individual probability densities `P_i` for `N` events: `L = Product(P_i)` (Eq. 10.2).
    * The single-event probability density is `P_i = A_i * p(x_i; a)`, where `A_i` is the detection efficiency and `p(x_i; a)` is proportional to the interaction probability.
    * Normalize each measurement to assure unit probability for observing any event with its specific characteristics. The normalizing factor `A_i` is determined such that `Integral_t1^t2 [A_i * p(tau; T) d(tau)] = 1` (Eq. 10.5).
    * The normalized likelihood function for `N` events (e.g., for exponential decay) is `L(T) = Product(A_i * e^(-tau_i/T))` (Eq. 10.6).
    * The logarithm of the likelihood function is `M = ln L = Sum(ln P_i)`.
    * For a large number of events, maximum-likelihood and least-squares methods must yield the same parameter estimate.
    * For a large number of events, the likelihood function (`L`) will be a Gaussian function of the parameter near the optimum value (Eq. 10.10), and `M(T)` will vary quadratically.
4. **Chi-Squared Test (Goodness of Fit):**
    * Estimate goodness of fit by comparing a data histogram to a prediction (possibly Monte Carlo simulated) using a chi-squared test.
    * Chi-squared (`chi^2`) is defined as `chi^2 = Sum_i[(y_i - y(x_i))^2 / sigma_i^2]` (Eq. 11.3).
    * Chi-squared (`chi^2`) can be related to the logarithm of the likelihood function by `chi^2 = -2ln(L) + constant` (Eq. 10.9).
    * Degrees of freedom (`v`) for fitting `N` data points with `m` parameters is `v = N - m`.
    * For a $\chi^2$ test, the number of degrees of freedom ($\nu$) is the number of sample frequencies ($n$) minus the number of constraints or parameters ($n_p$) calculated from the data to describe the probability function $NP(x_j)$. $\langle \chi^2 \rangle = \nu = n - n_p$.
    * If `chi^2` is calculated from parent function parameters, degrees of freedom `v = N`.
    * If two distributions ($g(x_j)$ and $h(x_j)$) are obtained completely independently, the expectation value of $\chi^2$ for their comparison is $\nu=n$.
    * If one distribution ($g(x_j)$ or $h(x_j)$) has been normalized to the other, the expectation value of $\chi^2$ for their comparison is $\nu=n-1$.
    * Reduced chi-squared (`chi_nu^2`) is `chi_nu^2 = chi^2 / v = s^2_fit / <sigma^2>` (Eq. 11.4).
    * For a good fit, the reduced chi-squared (`chi_nu^2`) should be approximately 1.
    * For a reasonable fit, the chi-squared probability `P(chi^2; v)` should be approximately 0.5, or reduced chi-squared should be reasonably close to 1 (e.g., less than 1.5).
    * The integral probability `P(chi^2; v)` is the integral of $p_\nu(\chi^2)$ from $\chi^2$ to infinity (Eq. 11.10).
    * `chi^2` distributed quantities are additive for degrees of freedom.
    * The sum of squares of deviations `S_y^2 = Sum_i[(y_i - Y_bar)^2]` (Eq. 11.42) follows a `chi^2` distribution with `N-1` degrees of freedom.
    * `S_y^2` can be decomposed into two `chi^2` distributed terms: `S_y^2 = R^2 * Sum_i[(y_i - Y_bar)^2] + (1 - R^2) * Sum_i[(y_i - y(x_i))^2]` (Eq. 11.48), with `m-1` and `N-m` degrees of freedom, respectively.
5. **Parameter Uncertainty Estimation:**
    * Estimate uncertainty (`sigma`) in a parameter by finding the change in parameter value needed to decrease `M` by `Delta M = 1/2` from its maximum value (corresponding to `Delta chi^2 = 1`).
    * If the likelihood function is sufficiently Gaussian, calculate parameter uncertainty from `sigma^2 = -1 / (d^2 M / da^2)` (Eq. 10.22).
    * If the likelihood function does not follow a Gaussian distribution, estimate uncertainty by numerical integration to find limiting values that include ~68.3% of the total area (for 1 standard deviation limit), or by calculating an average value of the second derivative using `sigma^2 = [Integral(d^2M/da^2 * L(a) da)] / [Integral(L(a) da)]` (Eq. 10.23).
    * For low statistics, use Monte Carlo simulation to determine parameter uncertainties; this is often the most reliable method.
6. **Weighted Data Analysis:**
    * The weighting factor (`w_i`) for each measurement is `w_i = (1/sigma_i^2) / ((1/N) * Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2])` (Eq. 11.2).
    * The weighted average of individual variances (`<sigma^2>`) is `(1/N) * Sum_i[(1/sigma_i^2) * sigma_i^2] / ((1/N) * Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2])` (Eq. 11.5).
    * If uncertainties are unequal, weighting factors `1/sigma_i^2` must be included in the definitions of variances, covariances, and correlation coefficients.
        * Weighted sample covariance: `s_jk = (Sum_i[(1/sigma_i^2) * (x_ji - X_j_bar) * (x_ki - X_k_bar)]) / (Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2])` (Eq. 11.31a).
        * Weighted sample variance: `s_j^2 = (Sum_i[(1/sigma_i^2) * (x_ji - X_j_bar)^2]) / (Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2])` (Eq. 11.31b).
        * Weighted means: `X_j_bar = Sum_i[(x_ji/sigma_i^2)] / Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2]` (Eq. 11.31c).
        * Weighting factors: `w_i = (1/sigma_i^2) / ((1/N) * Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2])` (Eq. 11.32).
7. **Linear Regression Parameters:**
    * The slope `b` of a straight-line fit `y = a + bx` is `b = (N * Sum(x_i*y_i) - Sum(x_i)*Sum(y_i)) / (N * Sum(x_i^2) - (Sum(x_i))^2)` (Eq. 11.12).
    * The inverse slope `b'` of a straight-line fit `x = a' + b'y` is `b' = (N * Sum(x_i*y_i) - Sum(x_i)*Sum(y_i)) / (N * Sum(y_i^2) - (Sum(y_i))^2)` (Eq. 11.14).
    * For complete linear correlation between `x` and `y`, `b * b' = 1`.
8. **Correlation Coefficients:**
    * The experimental linear-correlation coefficient `r` is `r = sqrt(b * b') = (N * Sum(x_i*y_i) - Sum(x_i)*Sum(y_i)) / sqrt((N * Sum(x_i^2) - (Sum(x_i))^2) * (N * Sum(y_i^2) - (Sum(y_i))^2))` (Eq. 11.17).
    * The probability distribution `p_nu(r; v)` for linear-correlation coefficient `r` (for uncorrelated parent population) is `p_nu(r; v) = (1/sqrt(pi)) * (Gamma((v+1)/2) / Gamma(v/2)) * (1 - r^2)^((v-2)/2)` (Eq. 11.18), where `v = N - 2` degrees of freedom.
    * The integral probability `P(r; N)` that a random sample of `N` uncorrelated points yields a linear-correlation coefficient as large as `|r|` is `P(r; N) = 2 * Integral_r^1 [p_nu(x; v) dx]` (Eq. 11.19). A small `P(r; N)` implies variables are probably correlated.
    * The sample covariance `s_jk` is `s_jk = (1/(N-1)) * Sum_i[(x_ji - X_j_bar) * (x_ki - X_k_bar)]` (Eq. 11.21).
    * The means `X_j_bar` and `Y_bar` are `X_j_bar = (1/N) * Sum(x_ji)` and `Y_bar = (1/N) * Sum(y_i)` (Eq. 11.22).
    * The sample linear-correlation coefficient `r_jk` between any two variables `x_j` and `x_k` is `r_jk = s_jk / (s_j * s_k)` (Eq. 11.26).
    * The linear-correlation coefficient `r_jy` between the `j`th variable `x_j` and the dependent variable `y` is `r_jy = s_jy / (s_j * s_y)` (Eq. 11.27).
    * The parent population linear-correlation coefficient `rho_jk` is `rho_jk = sigma_jk / (sigma_j * sigma_k)` (Eq. 11.28).
    * The linear-correlation coefficient `r_mx_y` for polynomial terms (between `y` and `x^m`) is defined via Equation 11.30.
    * The square of the linear-correlation coefficient `r^2` can be expressed as `r^2 = s_xy^2 / (s_x^2 * s_y^2) = b * s_xy / s_y^2` (Eq. 11.33).
    * Use linear-correlation coefficient (`r`) to test if a particular variable should be included in the fitting function.
    * The multiple-correlation coefficient `R` is defined as `R^2 = Sum_j(b_j * s_jy / s_y^2)` (Eq. 11.34).
    * Use multiple-correlation coefficient (`R`) to characterize the fit of data to the entire function and optimize its theoretical functional form.
9. **F-Statistic (Comparison of Variances/Fits):**
    * The F statistic is `F = (chi_1^2 / v1) / (chi_2^2 / v2)` (Eq. 11.35), where `chi_1^2` and `chi_2^2` follow chi-squared distributions with `v1` and `v2` degrees of freedom.
    * The F statistic can also be expressed as `F = (s_1^2 / sigma_1^2) / (s_2^2 / sigma_2^2)` (Eq. 11.37).
    * The integral probability `P_F(F; v1, v2)` for the F statistic is the integral of $p_F(f; v1, v2)$ from `F` to infinity (Eq. 11.38).
    * The F_R statistic is `F_R = [R^2 / (m-1)] / [(1-R^2) / (N-m)]` (Eq. 11.49).
    * A large F_R value (exceeding a test value F) indicates a good fit and that coefficients are nonzero. If `F_R < F`, at least one fitting term is invalid and its coefficient should be zero.
    * The difference `chi^2(m) - chi^2(m+1)` (when adding one term to a fit) follows a `chi^2` distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
    * The F_A statistic for an additional term is `F_A = (chi^2(m) - chi^2(m+1)) / (chi^2(m+1) / (N-m-1))` (Eq. 11.50).
    * A large F_A value (exceeding a test value F) indicates the additional term significantly improves the fit and its coefficient is nonzero.
    * The important figure of merit for added terms is `(chi^2(m) - chi^2(m+1)) / (chi_nu^2(m+1))`.
10. **Confidence Intervals:**
    * A 68.3% confidence level for a one-parameter fit means there is approximately a 68.3% probability that the true parameter value lies between `X - s` and `X + s`.
    * For any distribution, the probability `P` that a parameter measurement falls between `X-a` and `X+b` is `P = Integral_X-a^X+b [p(x; X) dx]` (Eq. 11.52).
    * For a 90% confidence interval, it corresponds to $X \pm 1.64 s_X$.
    * For a 95% confidence level, it corresponds to approximately $\pm 2$ standard deviations.
    * For multiparameter fits, define confidence intervals using the larger contour diagram (allowing other parameters to vary to their optimum values for each tested parameter value).
    * A `Delta chi^2 = 1` contour (with other parameters optimized) represents the 1 standard deviation (68.3% probability) limit for a single parameter.
    * A `Delta chi^2 = 4` contour (with other parameters optimized) represents the 2 standard deviation limit for a single parameter.
    * For a joint 1 standard deviation (68.3% probability) region of two parameters, draw the `Delta chi^2 = 2.30` contour.
    * For a joint 2 standard deviation region of two parameters, draw the `Delta chi^2 = 6.14` contour.
11. **Variance of Fit:** The variance of the fit (`s^2_fit`) is given by `s^2_fit = (1/(N-m)) * Sum_i[(1/sigma_i^2) * (y_i - y(x_i))^2] / ((1/N) * Sum_i[1/sigma_i^2])` (Eq. 11.1).

### VIII. Scaling, Dimensional Analysis & Parameter Transformations

1. **Gaussian Distribution (Standard Form Scaling):** To obtain a Gaussian probability function $p_G(x; \mu, \sigma)$ for any $\mu$ and $\sigma$ from the standard form $p_G(z)$, change the variable to $z = (x - \mu)/\sigma$ and scale the function by $1/\sigma$ to preserve normalization.
2. **Gaussian Deviate Scaling:** Generate Gaussian deviates from the standard distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1) and scale to different means $\mu$ and standard deviations $\sigma$ by $x = \sigma z + \mu$.

### IX. Stochastic Processes & Random Number Generation

1. **Binomial Distribution (Symmetry):** The binomial distribution is symmetric about its mean $\mu$ if the probability for a single success ($p$) equals the probability for failure ($q=1-p=1/2$).
2. **Poisson Distribution (Asymmetry):** The Poisson distribution is asymmetric about its mean $\mu$ (unless $\mu$ is large, in which case it approximates a Gaussian).
3. **Poisson Distribution (Asymmetry near Mean):** If $\mu$ is an integer, the probability for $x=\mu$ is equal to the probability for $x=\mu-1$.
4. **Poisson Distribution (Small Samples from Large Populations):** The Poisson distribution is appropriate for describing small samples from large populations.
5. **Probability Conservation (Transformation Method):** In the transformation method for generating random deviates from a probability distribution $P(x)$, the probability $r$ from a uniform distribution ($p(r)$) is related to $P(x)$ by $r = \int_{-\infty}^x P(x) dx$.
6. **Random Number Generators (Properties):** A good random number generator should produce numbers whose distribution is uniform and satisfies statistical tests for randomness; the calculation should produce a large number of unique numbers before repeating; and the calculation should be very fast.
7. **Statistical Uncertainties (Poisson):** For statistical fluctuations described by a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation is automatically determined as $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu}$. For data grouped in bins to form a histogram, the number of events in each bin obeys Poisson statistics.
8. **Peak Area Uncertainty (Poisson):** The uncertainty in the area of the peak `sigma_A_p^2 = sigma_A_total^2 + sigma_A_b^2`. For Poisson statistics, this simplifies to `A_p + A_b`.

### X. Units, Conventions & Mathematical Definitions

1. **Angle Units (Uncertainty in Functions):** The uncertainty in an angle ($\sigma_u$) must be expressed in radians when calculating uncertainties in angle functions (e.g., $\sin(u)$, $\cos(u)$).
2. **Parameter Notation (Parent vs. Experimental):** Use Greek letters ($\mu$, $\sigma$) to denote parent distribution parameters, and Latin letters ($\bar{x}$, $s$) to denote experimental estimates of them.
3. **Summation Notation:** The sum of all measurements $x_i$ from $i=1$ to $N$ is denoted by $\sum x_i$ (omitting the index and limits).
4. **Gaussian Probability Density Function:** `p_g(x; mu, sigma) = (1 / (sigma * sqrt(2*pi))) * exp[-(x-mu)^2 / (2*sigma^2)]` (Eq. 11.51).
5. **Gaussian Integral Probability:** `P_g(x; mu, sigma) = Integral_mu-z*sigma^mu+z*sigma [p_g(x; mu, sigma) dx]`, where `z = |x-mu|/sigma`.
6. **F Probability Distribution Function:** `p_F(f; v1, v2) = [Gamma((v1+v2)/2) / (Gamma(v1/2)*Gamma(v2/2))] * (v1/v2)^(v1/2) * f^((v1-2)/2) * (1 + (v1/v2)f)^(-(v1+v2)/2)` (Eq. 11.36).
7. **Gamma Function:** `Gamma(n)` is defined by `Gamma(1) = 1`, `Gamma(n+1) = n * Gamma(n)`. For integral `n`, `Gamma(n+1) = n!`. For half-integral `n`, `Gamma(n+1/2) = n(n-1)...(1/2) * sqrt(pi)` (Eq. 11.7).
8. **Student's t Distribution:** `p_t(t; v) = (1 / (sqrt(v*pi))) * (Gamma((v+1)/2) / Gamma(v/2)) * (1 + t^2/v)^(-(v+1)/2)` (as quoted from Review of Particle Physics).

### XI. Variational Principles & Optimization

1. **Least-Squares Minimization:** Minimize the weighted sum of the squares of deviations $\chi^2$ to find the optimum fit parameters.
2. **Parameter Optimization Condition:** To find the values of parameters that yield the minimum value for $\chi^2$ or maximum value for likelihood (`L` or `M=ln L`), set the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter to zero ($\frac{\partial \chi^2}{\partial a_j} = 0$, $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a_j} = 0$, or $\frac{\partial M}{\partial a_j} = 0$).

### XII. Experiment Design & Data Acquisition

1. **Geometric Correction Factor Dependence:** Minimize the dependence of geometric correction factors on the parameters sought in the experiment.
2. **Fiducial Region Optimization:** Choose the fiducial region to maximize the overall quality of the result, considering trade-offs between the number of surviving events and their measurement precision.

## Key Highlights

* A reduced chi-squared value significantly deviating from 1 (either too large or too small) indicates issues; a small value may signal errors in uncertainty assignment, while a large value suggests data sets are drawn from different distributions.
* Report uncertainties at 1 standard deviation (68.3% confidence level) and resist the temptation to arbitrarily increase error estimates 'just to be sure,' as this compromises methodological integrity.
* Do not discard data points repeatedly, nor attempt to extract information from bins smaller than measurement uncertainties or with too few events to satisfy Gaussian statistics (e.g., mean < 10).
* Be aware of local minima in nonlinear fitting, as a poor choice of starting point can lead to suboptimal solutions; always determine robust starting values for parameters beforehand.
* Do not consider results extremely accurate if precision is low due to systematic errors, and always understand and correct for biases introduced by event losses or low efficiency regions.
* To avoid computer underflow when maximizing the likelihood function, always maximize its logarithm (`ln L`) instead, which should yield a reasonable negative number.
* Always validate Monte Carlo programs by checking random number distributions for correlations, examining intermediate results, and rechecking calculations if they violate intuition.
* Determine parameter uncertainties by finding the change in parameter value that decreases the logarithm of the likelihood function by 1/2 (or Δχ² = 1) from its maximum; for low statistics, Monte Carlo simulation is often the most reliable method.

## Example ideas

* Conduct a systematic review of uncertainty assignment protocols, especially when observing very low reduced chi-squared values, to verify that uncertainties accurately reflect measurement precision and avoid misrepresentation.
* Establish and enforce a rigorous validation framework for all nonlinear fitting applications, including systematic checks for sensitivity to initial parameter guesses, potential for local minima, and ensuring the validity of the Chi-squared hypersurface parabolic approximation.
* Implement a mandatory validation suite for all Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on comprehensive testing of random number generator statistical properties and thorough examination of intermediate and final simulation results for consistency and absence of unexpected correlations.
* Evaluate current data binning strategies to ensure bin sizes are larger than measurement uncertainties and contain sufficient events to satisfy statistical assumptions (e.g., Gaussian statistics for Chi-squared calculations), merging low-count bins where necessary.
