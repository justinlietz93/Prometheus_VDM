If measurements *y_i* have a covariance matrix *V_ij = cov[y_i, y_j]*, determine estimators by finding the minimum of *χ²(θ) = (y - μ(θ))^T V⁻¹ (y - μ(θ))* (Eq. 40.20).
44. **Frequentist Hypothesis Test:** Specify a critical region *w* in the data space. The probability of finding data *x* in *w* (under *H0*) must not exceed the specified size of the test *α*. Reject *H0* if the observed data falls within *w*. If data is discrete, *P(x ∈ w|H0) ≤ α*.
45. **Neyman-Pearson Lemma:** To maximize test power, choose the critical region *w* such that the likelihood ratio *Λ(x) = L(x|H1) / L(x|H0)* (Eq. 40.44) is *≥ cα* for all *x ∈ w*, and *< cα* outside *w*. Determine *cα* by the size of the test *α*.
46. **p-value Calculation:** A p-value quantifies agreement between *H0* and observed data *x*. Specify a subset of the data space that includes *x_obs* and represents data equally or less compatible with *H0*. Use constant values of a scalar statistic *t(x)* to define surfaces of equal compatibility. If large *t* implies poor agreement, calculate the p-value as *P(t > t_obs | H0)*.

55. **Confidence Interval Construction (Frequentist):** Given a p.d.f. *f(x;θ)*, use a pre-defined rule and probability *1-α* to find for every value of *θ*, a set of values *x1(θ, α)* and *x2(θ, α)* such that *P(x1 ≤ x ≤ x2; θ) = ∫_(x1)^(x2) f(x;θ) dx ≥ 1-α* (Eq. 40.73).
56. **Gaussian Confidence Interval:** For data consisting of a single random variable *x* following a Gaussian distribution with known *σ*, the probability that the measured value *x* falls within *±δ* of the true value *μ* is *1-α = (1/√(2π)σ) ∫_(x-δ)^(x+δ) e^[- (x'-μ)² / (2σ²)] dx'* (Eq. 40.76).
57. **One-Sided Limits:** A one-sided (upper or lower) limit can be set by excluding above *x+δ* (or below *x-δ*). The *α* values for one-sided limits are half the values given for two-sided limits (e.g., Table 40.1).

63. **Missing Transverse Energy Vector:** The net transverse momentum of invisible particles is equal to the missing transverse energy vector *E_T_miss = - Σ_i p_T(i)* (Eq. 49.49), where the sum runs over transverse momenta of all visible final state particles.
64. **Transverse Mass (M_T):** The mass of the parent particle can be constrained with the quantity *M_T* (transverse mass), defined as *M_T² = [E_T(1) + E_T(2)]² - [p_T(1) + p_T(2)]² = m1² + m2² + 2[E_T(1)E_T(2) - p_T(1) · p_T(2)]* (Eq. 49.50).

39. **Λ_c+ and Ξ_c+ Decay Branching Fraction Corrections:** Branching fractions for Λ_c+ and Ξ_c+ are corrected for decay modes not observed (e.g., K*(892)0 → K0π0 decays are multiplied up).
40. **Muon/Electron-Neutrino-Gamma Decay Consistency:** Measurements of *Γ(e±ν)* and *Γ(µ±ν)* *always* include decays with γ's. Measurements of *Γ(e±νγ)* and *Γ(µ±νγ)* *never* include low-energy γ's.

The measurements do not necessarily have to follow a Gaussian distribution for these estimators.
51. **MLE Standard Deviations Method:** Apply the method for standard deviations (Eq. 40.13) in the large sample limit.
52. **Least Squares Applicability:** The method of least squares is applicable for Gaussian distributed measurements *y_i* with mean *μ(x_i;θ)* and known variance *σ_i²*, or if measurements *y_i* have a covariance matrix *V_ij = cov[y_i, y_j]*.

Assume the goodness-of-fit statistic follows a χ² p.d.f. under the hypothesis.
55. **Neyman Procedure Validity:** The limits from the Neyman procedure (Eqs. 40.82a, 40.82b for Poisson; Eqs. 40.83a, 40.83b for Binomial) apply under their respective distributional assumptions.

57. **Resonant Cross Sections (Narrow Resonance):** Resonant cross sections, for a narrow resonance, may have the Breit-Wigner factor replaced by *πΓ δ(E - E0) / 2*.
58. **QCD Cross Section Assumptions (Massless Quarks):** The cross section for *qqbar → q'qbar'* (Eq. 51.4) requires treating all quarks as massless and averaging over initial quark colors. For hadroproduction of heavy quarks *Q = c, b, t*, include mass effects in the formulae.
59. **Higgs to Gluon Loop Function (Limits):** For *I(z)* in Higgs decay to gluons, *I(z)* is complex for *z < 1/4*. For *z < 2 x 10⁻³*, *|I(z)|* is small, so light quarks contribute negligibly to *Γ(H → gg)*.

64. **Single Production with Semi-Invisible Final States:** When considering a single heavy particle decaying to two particles (one invisible, particle 1), use the definitions for *M_T* (Eq. 49.50) and *E_T(1)* (Eq. 49.51). If *m1 = m2 = 0*, *M_T² = 2|p_T(1)||p_T(2)|(1 - cos φ_12)* (Eq. 49.52).
65. **Pair Production with Semi-Invisible Final States:** For pair production with semi-invisible final states, assume two identical heavy particles of mass *M* are produced such that their combined center-of-mass is at rest in the transverse plane.
66. **K± Decay Form Factors:** K± decay form factors can be assumed with μ-e universality or not.

## Key Highlights

* Energy and momentum must transform via Lorentz transformation, with the square of a particle's 4-momentum, E² - |p|², being invariant and equal to its mass squared, m².
* Matrix elements for scattering or decay processes are expressed using an invariant amplitude *-iM*, which is central to calculating partial decay rates and differential cross sections, such as *dσ/dt = (1/(16πs²)) |M|²* for two-body scattering.
* The Friedmann equations and the energy conservation equation *ρ̇ = -3H(ρ+P)* are essential for deriving and describing the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe based on its matter and energy content.
* Fundamental symmetries like CPT imply the equality of particle and antiparticle masses and widths. Electric charge conservation is tied to QED gauge symmetry, and lepton-flavor violation in charged lepton transitions has not been observed.
* The Standard Model Higgs boson has a mass of 125.20 ± 0.11 GeV. Its production cross section and decay partial widths are crucial parameters described by specific formulae depending on the decay channel.
* The probability of a particle living for a time *t0* before decaying follows *P(t0) = e^(-t0/τ)*. Resonant cross sections are generally described by the Breit-Wigner formula, which is critical for understanding particle resonances.
* The mean rate of energy loss for moderately relativistic charged heavy particles is accurately described by the Bethe equation, while phenomena like synchrotron radiation contribute significantly to energy loss in accelerators.
* Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs) and the Least Squares method are primary techniques for parameter estimation, while the Chi-Squared distribution provides a framework for goodness-of-fit tests and for constructing confidence intervals.
* For processes involving invisible final state particles at hadron colliders, their net transverse momentum is measured as the missing transverse energy vector *E_T_miss*. The transverse mass *M_T* is then used to constrain the mass of the parent particle, exhibiting an endpoint at *M_T^max = M*.
* The differential spectrum of charged cosmic rays exhibits a power-law dependence *E⁻γ*, with distinct changes in the spectral index occurring at characteristic energies known as the 'knee,' 'second knee,' and 'ankle'.

## Example ideas

* Develop or integrate automated tools for verifying adherence to the fundamental kinematic, dynamic, and statistical rules outlined in the summary across event generators, detector simulations, and analysis pipelines, ensuring consistency and correctness.
* Conduct a focused review of current experimental constraints on unobserved phenomena (e.g., lepton-flavor violation, neutrinoless double-beta decay, proton decay, dark matter candidates) to identify and prioritize next-generation search strategies that push these limits further or explore parameter spaces where the Standard Model predicts zero.
* Establish a working group to standardize and cross-validate critical statistical methodology implementations (e.g., Maximum Likelihood Estimation, confidence interval construction, hypothesis testing procedures) against benchmark datasets to enhance the robustness and comparability of physics results across experiments.
* Perform a systematic sensitivity analysis for key Standard Model measurements (e.g., Higgs boson properties, W/Z boson widths) to variations in underlying Beyond-Standard-Model assumptions or model dependencies, and develop strategies for reporting results with reduced reliance on specific new physics models.
