## **I. Essay Structure & Content**

* **Topic Selection:**
  * Choose a topic that is important to you.
  * Formulate your chosen topic as a question you want to answer.
  * Do not waste time with ideas that do not grip you.
* **Paragraph Structure:**
  * Ensure each paragraph presents a single idea.
  * Aim for paragraphs to be about 10 sentences or 100 words long as a guiding rule.
  * Break up paragraphs that ramble on for 300 words or more, as they likely contain more than one idea.
* **Overall Organization:**
  * Arrange all paragraphs in a logical progression from the beginning of the essay to the end.
  * Ensure the essay works at all seven levels of resolution simultaneously (words, sentences, paragraphs, overall essay, reader, cultural context, biological context).
* **Submission:**
  * Hand in something, no matter how imperfect, rather than nothing.
  * Include a title page with your final essay.

## **II. Writing Process & Drafts**

* **Time Management:**
  * Do not wait for large chunks of free time to start writing.
  * Do not attempt to write for six hours continuously; three hours is a maximum for sustained daily writing.
  * Write every day, at least a bit (e.g., 15 minutes).
  * When first sitting down to write, refuse distractions for at least fifteen minutes (25 minutes on a bad day) to settle your mind.
* **First Draft:**
  * Produce a first draft that is 25% longer than the final version's target length.
  * Do not worry excessively about sentence structure or grammar during the first draft.
  * Separate the production (first draft) and editing phases; do not attempt to combine them.
* **Outlining:**
  * Mandatorily create an outline for your essay.
  * For a 1000-word essay, use a ten-sentence outline.
  * Limit the fundamental (primary) outline of an essay to no more than fifteen sentences.
  * If the essay is longer than a thousand words, create sub-outlines for each primary outline sentence.
  * Aim for one outline heading per 100 words of essay length.
  * After the initial draft, generate a *new* outline of ten to fifteen sentences from memory of the essay. Do not look back at your essay while doing this.
  * Construct the final essay by cutting and pasting material from the previous draft into the new outline.
  * Do not be afraid to discard unnecessary material during the final outlining and assembly phase.
* **Iteration:**
  * Repeat the process of sentence rewriting and re-ordering, paragraph re-ordering, and re-outlining until the essay cannot be improved further.

## **III. Sentence & Paragraph Mechanics**

* **Word Choice:**
  * Ensure each word is precisely the right word and in the correct location within each sentence.
  * Do not use any word that you would be uncomfortable to use in spoken conversation; avoid words used solely to impress.
  * Write clearly at a vocabulary level you have mastered (with some stretching for improvement).
* **Sentence Construction:**
  * Ensure each sentence presents a single thought (part of the paragraph's idea) and is grammatically correct.
  * Eliminate all unnecessary words from sentences during editing.
  * Aim to cut the length of each sentence by 15-25% during editing.
  * Read each sentence aloud to check for awkwardness and rewrite it for improvement.
* **Sentence Ordering:**
  * Arrange and sequence each sentence properly within its paragraph.
  * Ensure sentences within each paragraph are in the best possible order.
  * Eliminate unnecessary sentences from paragraphs during editing.
* **Paragraph Ordering:**
  * Ensure paragraphs are ordered appropriately within the entire essay.
* **Style:**
  * Strive for brevity (concise and efficient expression).
  * Strive for beauty (melodic or poetic aspect) in your language.

## **IV. Research & Citation**

* **Source Quantity:**
  * Assume a need for 5-10 books or articles per thousand words of essay, unless otherwise instructed.
* **Note-taking:**
  * Do not bother highlighting or underlining sentences in textbooks when taking notes.
  * Do not ever copy source material word for word into your notes.
  * Read for understanding, then write down what you have learned or questions that have arisen.
  * Take about two to three times as many notes (by word count) as you will need for your essay.
  * Derive 8-10 topic questions from your notes.
* **Referencing:**
  * Refer to sources for any sentence that contains a fact or informed opinion acquired from reading, to avoid plagiarism.
  * Master at least one citation convention (e.g., APA).
  * Follow the specific conventions covering the use of a direct quote when directly quoting someone.
  * Add all necessary references within the text.
  * Add a reference list to the end of your essay.
  * Construct both in-text references and the reference list according to APA convention, or another specified set of rules.

## **V. Workspace & Habits**

* **Technology:**
  * Use a computer for writing.
  * Use two screens, set up side-by-side.
  * Use a good keyboard; do not use notebook keyboards for continuous work.
  * Use a good mouse; do not use touchpads for continuous work.
* **Ergonomics:**
  * Set up keyboards so you are looking directly at their centers when sitting straight.
  * Use a decent chair.
  * Sit so your feet can rest comfortably on the floor with knees bent 90 degrees.
* **Physiological Habits:**
  * Get up and eat something in the morning.
  * Consume protein and fat for breakfast; coffee alone is counter-productive.
  * Prepare to spend between 90 minutes and three hours writing.

## **VI. Overall Essay Quality**

* Do not be bored while writing; if you are, you are doing it wrong.
* Ensure you are trying to produce something of worth, beauty, and elegance.

## Key Highlights

* Choose a topic that genuinely interests you, framing it as a question you wish to answer.
* Write daily, even for short periods like 15 minutes, and dedicate focused, distraction-free time when starting.
* Mandatorily create an outline before writing and then generate a new outline from memory after the initial draft to refine the essay structure.
* Separate the production of the first draft from editing; focus on getting ideas down without excessive worry about grammar initially.
* Ensure each paragraph presents a single idea, ideally around 10 sentences or 100 words long.
* Strive for precise word choice and brevity, eliminating unnecessary words and aiming to cut sentence length by 15-25% during editing.
* Always refer to sources for facts or informed opinions to avoid plagiarism, and master a standard citation convention.
* Prioritize submitting something, however imperfect, over submitting nothing at all.
* Set up an ergonomic workspace with a computer, two screens, and quality peripherals to support continuous, comfortable writing.

## Next Steps & Suggestions

* Develop a comprehensive 'Writer's Toolkit' template and checklist that operationalizes the structural, process, and mechanical rules for essay creation.
* Design and implement a structured training program for writers, focusing on the practical application and understanding of these detailed guidelines.
* Evaluate potential software solutions or AI integrations that could automate compliance checks for rules such as paragraph/sentence length, outlining structure, and citation formatting.
* Conduct a pilot study with a cohort of writers to empirically measure the impact of adherence to these rules on overall essay quality, writing efficiency, and writer satisfaction.
