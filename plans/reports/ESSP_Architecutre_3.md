### **Summary of Technical Specification: Event-Sourced Structural Plasticity**

This document outlines the design of a sparse, event-driven structural plasticity framework for a runtime connectome, replacing all dense, global operations with local, sub-quadratic, and computationally budgeted mechanisms. The system's core philosophy is that all structural changes—synapse formation, pruning, and neuron culling—emerge from local interactions rather than static, pre-configured rules.

#### **1. Core Architecture: The Event-Sourced Pipeline**

The architecture is a unidirectional, decoupled pipeline ensuring scalability and adherence to the strict sparse-only constraint. It explicitly forbids global scans, with a hard assertion failure guarding against dense homeostasis routines unless explicitly forced.

1.  **Walkers (Read-Only Agents):** Traverse local graph territories, compute metrics (e.g., co-activity, metabolic load), and emit `Tag` events upon crossing thresholds. They do not modify the connectome.
2.  **Tag Events (Proposals):** Atomic messages published to the Event Bus, specifying a proposed change (e.g., `tag.prune_synapse`), its coordinates, a reason code (e.g., `LOW_USE`, `EXCITOTOX`), a vote weight, and a time-to-live (TTL).
3.  **Event Bus (Transport):** A hierarchical message broker for delivering tags.
4.  **Scoreboard (Evidence Aggregator):** A stateful service that consumes, coalesces, and aggregates tags into decaying votes for each entity (neuron/synapse). It prevents actuator thrash by integrating noisy signals into stable decisions.
5.  **GDSP Actuator (Sole Write Authority):** The **G**oal **D**irected **S**tructural **P**lasticity Actuator is the only component with write access. It executes surgical, CSR-safe operations (`apply_prune`, `apply_grow`, etc.) based on threshold-crossing events from the Scoreboard, strictly respecting per-tick computational budgets.

#### **2. Neuron and Synapse Dynamics**

The framework supports diverse neuronal roles through heterogeneous classes and a foundational activity-dependent update rule.

*   **Heterogeneous Neuron Classes:** The system defines multiple neuron types (e.g., **Relay, Inhibitory, Integrator, Purkinje-like**), each with distinct rarity, target connectivity degrees (`k_target`), learning rates (`η`), and decay rates (`λ`). These parameters are stored in on-device vectors managed by a `PlasticityManager`.
*   **Synaptic Update Rule:** A vectorized kernel updates active synaptic weights (`w_ij`) based on Hebbian reinforcement and passive decay:
    $$
    w_{ij}(t+1) \leftarrow \operatorname{clip}\Big((1-\lambda_{ij}) \cdot w_{ij}(t) + \eta_{ij} \cdot e_{ij}(t) \cdot M_t, \; [w_{\min}, w_{\max}]\Big)
    $$
    *   **`λ_ij`, `η_ij`**: Per-edge decay and learning rates derived from the pre- and post-synaptic neuron classes.
    *   **`e_ij(t)`**: A synaptic eligibility trace tracking co-activity.
    *   **`M_t`**: A global or territory-local modulatory signal (e.g., TD-error, novelty), coupled to the system's high-level `sie.void_debt` objective.

#### **3. Biologically-Analogous Structural Mechanisms**

Higher-order changes are governed by specific walkers modeling physiological processes.

*   **Selective Pruning (Microglia–C3 Analog):** A two-stage process where a `ComplementTagger` walker first marks volatile, low-efficacy synapses with `tag.C3`. A `Microglia` walker then "engulfs" them by emitting a definitive `tag.prune_synapse` only if corroborated by other signals like low use, ensuring a quorum for destructive actions.
*   **Neuron Culling:** Gated by severe pathological signals:
    *   **Excitotoxicity:** Triggered by sustained high firing rates and integrated membrane potential.
    *   **Metabolic Homeostasis:** A `MetabolicAuditor` walker monitors territory-local `metabolic_debt` (distinct from the global `sie.void_debt`). Persistent debt triggers pruning of high-cost synapses, followed by culling of high-contributing neurons.
    *   **Apoptosis:** Integrates multiple danger signals into a single score; triggers graceful, chunk-wise detachment of a neuron's synapses.
*   **Connectome Repair (Bridging):** If a territory's Union-Find structure reports fragmentation (components > 1), the GDSP Actuator performs a budgeted bridging operation, creating new edges between component boundaries to restore cohesion.

#### **4. Emergent and Physics-Informed Control**

A key design evolution was the replacement of all static limits with emergent, self-tuning rules derived from local, observable signals.

*   **Emergent Budgets:** A `BudgetGovernor` dynamically computes per-tick budgets (`PRUNE_BUDGET`, `GROW_BUDGET`) from territory signals like bus backpressure, cohesion (fragmentation), `metabolic_debt`, and event entropy.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** The Scoreboard replaces fixed cutoffs with adaptive gates based on the running mean and standard deviation of tag strengths within a territory (μ+κ·σ).
*   **Dynamic Target Degree (`k*`):** Each neuron's target degree is not fixed but is a dynamic target (`k*`) computed from its class-based prior, modulated by local signals like metabolic load, void-debt, and a "void-gravity" field. This is bounded by territory size and hardware limits to prevent pathological states.
*   **Reaction-Diffusion (RD) for Evidence Spreading:** The influence of a tag event is modeled as a *local, event-scoped* Reaction-Diffusion field. This provides a physics-based model for how evidence diffuses and decays on the sparse graph before being integrated by the Scoreboard, without requiring any global simulation.
*   **Void-Gravity Prioritization:** A gravity-like, screened potential field, derived from local activity density, is used to prioritize bridging actions. The actuator preferentially creates edges that reduce the potential difference between fragmented components.

#### **5. Verification and Acceptance Criteria**

The implementation's success is defined by a rigorous set of automated "gates":

*   **No-Dense Gate:** Asserts failure if any dense homeostasis path is called without being explicitly forced.
*   **Budget Gate:** The number of structural modifications per tick must not exceed the dynamically computed budgets.
*   **Use-it-or-Lose-it Gate:** A significant fraction of known-idle pathways must be successfully pruned within a predictable, budget-limited timeframe.
*   **Cohesion/Repair Gate:** Induced fragmentation must be repaired (component count → 1) within a number of ticks proportional to the damage and the bridge budget.
*   **Emergent `k*` Gate:** Median degree per neuron class must remain within adaptive bands, demonstrating that the dynamic target is effective.
*   **Physics Gates:** Local RD patches must pass validation against analytical solutions for front-speed and dispersion.
*   **Topic Separation Gate:** Telemetry must confirm that runtime `metabolic_debt` and global `sie.void_debt` signals remain on distinct, non-crossing bus topics.

## Key Highlights

* The system employs a strictly sparse, event-driven pipeline architecture that replaces global operations with local, budgeted mechanisms, explicitly forbidding dense homeostasis routines.
* A key design principle is the shift from static, pre-configured limits to emergent, self-tuning rules, including dynamically computed budgets and adaptive thresholds based on local signals.
* A single "GDSP Actuator" is the sole write authority for the connectome, executing surgical modifications based on aggregated evidence from a Scoreboard service.
* Neuron target connectivity is not a fixed parameter but a dynamic target (`k*`) that is continuously modulated by local signals like metabolic load and a "void-gravity" field.
* Synapse pruning is modeled as a two-stage, biologically-analogous process (Microglia-C3) that requires a quorum of corroborating signals before taking destructive action.
* The influence of events is modeled using a local, event-scoped Reaction-Diffusion (RD) field, providing a physics-based mechanism for how evidence spreads and decays on the sparse graph.
* Neuron culling is triggered only by severe pathological signals, such as excitotoxicity or persistent metabolic debt, ensuring network stability.
* The system automatically detects and repairs network fragmentation using a Union-Find algorithm to trigger budgeted "bridging" operations between components.
* The design's success is enforced by strict, automated verification "gates," including a "No-Dense Gate" that asserts failure if sparse-only constraints are violated.

## Next Steps & Suggestions

* Schedule a design review to finalize the specification and create a phased implementation plan for each component (Walkers, Event Bus, Scoreboard, Actuator).
* Begin prototyping the core pipeline components, starting with the `Walker` agents and the `Tag` event structure.
* Develop a simulation environment to test the synaptic update rule and define initial parameters for the heterogeneous neuron classes.
* Formalize the API contracts between the major components (Event Bus, Scoreboard, GDSP Actuator) to enable parallel development efforts.
