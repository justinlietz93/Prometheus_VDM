## Generated Summary

This summary synthesizes a highly technical conversation transcript detailing the design, refinement, and physical underpinnings of an event-sourced structural plasticity framework for a neural connectome.

### **Summary of Event-Sourced Structural Plasticity Specification**

#### **1. Overarching Objective & Core Mandate**
The primary goal is to implement a comprehensive, biologically-plausible structural plasticity framework for a runtime connectome. The system's architectural mandate is an absolute prohibition of dense matrix scans or global polling. All operations—synapse formation, pruning, strengthening, decay, and neuron culling—must be achieved through a strictly sparse, event-driven, local, and computationally budgeted model with sub-quadratic complexity.

#### **2. Core Architecture: The Event-Sourced Pipeline**
The system is built on a unidirectional, decoupled pipeline, ensuring scalability and adherence to the sparse-only constraint.
**Pipeline Flow:** **Walker → Tag Event → Event Bus → Scoreboard → GDSP Actuator**

1.  **Walkers:** Lightweight, read-only agents that traverse local subgraphs. They compute metrics (e.g., co-activity, metabolic load) and emit `Tag` events upon crossing thresholds. They do not modify the connectome.
2.  **Tag Events:** Atomic, structured proposals for structural changes (e.g., `tag.prune_synapse`, `tag.cull_neuron`), each with a reason code, coordinates, and a time-to-live (TTL).
3.  **Event Bus:** A message broker for O(1) transport of `Tag` events.
4.  **Scoreboard:** A stateful service that aggregates `Tag` events. It maintains a decaying vote count for each entity, integrating noisy signals into stable decisions.
5.  **GDSP (Goal Directed Structural Plasticity) Actuator:** The sole component with write-access to the connectome. It acts only on threshold-crossing events from the Scoreboard, performing surgical, CSR-safe operations within strict per-tick budgets (e.g., `PRUNE_BUDGET`, `GROW_BUDGET`).

#### **3. Key System Components and Data Structures**

*   **Heterogeneous Neuron Classes:** The system supports multiple neuron classes, each with distinct parameters stored in on-device vectors. This allows for diverse functional roles and plasticity dynamics.

| Class | Rarity | Target Degree (`k_target`) | Learning Rate (`η`) | Decay Rate (`λ`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relay** | ~60% | 3–5 | 0.08 | 0.03 |
| **Inhibitory** | ~25% | 6–12 | 0.05 | 0.02 |
| **Integrator** | ~14% | 20–60 | 0.01 | 0.005 |
| **Purkinje-like**| ~1% | 200–500 | 0.002 | 0.0005|

*   **Canonical Tag Schema:** A standardized format for all structural change proposals, including reason codes such as `LOW_USE`, `C3_ENGULF`, `EXCITOTOX`, `METABOLIC_DEBT`, and `APOPTOSIS`.

#### **4. Plasticity Mechanisms and Triggers**

*   **Foundational Synaptic Dynamics:** A continuous, activity-dependent update rule governs synaptic weights ($w_{ij}$), combining Hebbian reinforcement and passive decay. The update is performed by a sparse GPU kernel.
    $$
    w_{ij}(t+1) \leftarrow \operatorname{clip}\Big((1-\lambda_{ij}) \cdot w_{ij}(t) + \eta_{ij} \cdot e_{ij}(t) \cdot M_t, \; [w_{\min}, w_{\max}]\Big)
    $$
    where $e_{ij}(t)$ is the synaptic eligibility trace and $M_t$ is a modulatory factor.

*   **Selective Pruning (Microglia–C3 Analog):** A two-stage, quorum-based mechanism. A `ComplementTagger` walker first marks volatile, low-efficacy synapses with a `tag.C3`. A `Microglia` walker then issues a definitive `tag.prune_synapse` only if the C3 tag is corroborated by other signals (e.g., low use).

*   **Neuron Culling:** Gated by severe pathological signals:
    *   **Excitotoxicity:** Triggered by sustained high firing rates (`r_i > r_max`) and prolonged depolarization (`c_i > c_max`).
    *   **Metabolic Homeostasis:** Triggered when a territory's `metabolic_debt` (work > supply) persists. It first prunes expensive synapses, then culls high-contributing neurons. This signal is distinct from the global `sie.void_debt`.
    *   **Apoptosis:** Triggered when an integrated danger score (combining excitotoxicity, metabolic stress, C3 hits, etc.) exceeds a threshold. Culling is performed gracefully by detaching synapses in chunks.

*   **Connectome Repair (Fragmentation Bridging):** A maintenance routine triggered when a territory's Union-Find (UF) structure reports more than one connected component. The GDSP Actuator performs budgeted bridging between components using alias sampling on boundary nodes.

#### **5. Refinements Toward Emergent, Self-Tuning Rules**
The initial specification with static configurations was refined to favor dynamic, emergent controls, eliminating hard-coded knobs.

*   **Dynamic Budgets:** Per-tick budgets (`B_T`) are not fixed constants but are computed dynamically for each territory based on local signals like bus backpressure, cohesion (fragmentation), metabolic debt, and event entropy.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Scoreboard thresholds (`θ`) are not static values. Instead, they adapt based on the running mean and standard deviation of tag strengths within a territory (`μ+κ·σ`), making actuation relative to local signal levels.
*   **Dynamic Target Degree (`k_target`):** The target degree for a neuron is not a fixed number but a dynamic target ($k^\star_i(t)$) that adapts based on its class, local metabolic state, and other signals. The actuator moves towards this target smoothly within its budget.
*   **Self-Calibrating Actuator:** A duty-cycle controller adjusts the adaptive thresholds (`TH_*`) to maintain a target actuator utilization (e.g., 70%), preventing both inactivity and thrashing.

#### **6. Physics-Based Underpinnings**
To ground the model in physics, advanced mechanisms were integrated into the sparse, event-driven framework.

*   **Reaction-Diffusion (RD) for Evidence Spreading:** RD is used not as a global PDE, but as a *local, event-scoped field* on small patches around tagged entities. It models the diffusion of evidence from a tag, governed by $\partial_t a = r\,a + D\,\nabla^2 a$. The parameters are derived from walker telemetry (tag birth/death rates), not constants. This field's amplitude informs the Scoreboard, providing a physical basis for evidence aggregation.
*   **Void-Gravity Field for Cohesion:** A gravity-like screened potential field ($V$) is computed locally per territory, sourced from activity density ($\rho$). It is used purely as a **priority signal** to guide existing mechanisms:
    *   **Bridging:** Prioritizes creating edges that reduce the potential difference between fragmented components.
    *   **Walkers:** Tag weights are modulated by the local potential gradient, encouraging pruning of misaligned connections and guiding growth.

#### **7. Verification and Acceptance Criteria**
The implementation is validated through a series of strict "gates":

*   **No-Dense Gate:** A hard assertion failure must occur if any dense homeostasis path is called without being explicitly forced (`FORCE_DENSE=1`).
*   **Budget Gate:** The total number of structural modifications per tick must not exceed the sum of the allocated (static or dynamic) budgets.
*   **Cohesion/Repair Gate:** An artificially fragmented territory must return to a single connected component within a predictable, budget-dependent timeframe.
*   **Use-it-or-Lose-it Gate:** A significant fraction of synapses on known idle pathways must be pruned, while those on stimulated pathways must show significant strengthening.
*   **Physics Gates:** For RD patches, the measured front-speed and dispersion must match theoretical predictions ($c_{\text{front}}=2\sqrt{Dr}$), ensuring the physics implementation is correct.
*   **Emergent Rules Gate:** Key metrics (e.g., actuator utilization, median degree) must be shown to converge to stable regimes driven by the dynamic controllers, not static limits.

## Key Highlights

* The system's architectural mandate is an absolute prohibition of dense matrix scans or global polling, enforcing a strictly sparse, event-driven, and local computational model.
* The core architecture is a decoupled, event-sourced pipeline (Walker → Tag → Bus → Scoreboard → Actuator) where read-only agents propose changes and a single, budget-constrained Actuator performs them.
* A major design refinement was the shift from static, hard-coded configurations to dynamic, self-tuning rules for operational budgets, decision thresholds, and neuron target degrees.
* Physics-based mechanisms like Reaction-Diffusion are used not as global simulations, but as local, event-scoped fields to model evidence aggregation from structural change proposals.
* A key verification criterion is a "No-Dense Gate," which triggers a hard assertion failure if any dense homeostasis pathway is executed, strictly enforcing the core sparse mandate.
* A local, gravity-like potential field, sourced from activity density, is used as a priority signal to guide connectome repair and pruning, rather than directly applying forces.
* Neuron culling is gated by severe pathological signals, including excitotoxicity from sustained high firing rates, persistent metabolic debt, and a high integrated apoptosis score.
* A self-calibrating controller dynamically adjusts actuator thresholds to maintain a target utilization rate (e.g., 70%), preventing both system inactivity and thrashing.
* Synapse pruning is a two-stage, quorum-based mechanism analogous to the Microglia-C3 complement system, requiring multiple corroborating signals before removal.
* A dedicated maintenance routine uses Union-Find data structures to detect network fragmentation and performs budgeted bridging between components to ensure cohesion.

## Next Steps & Suggestions

* Draft an implementation plan by breaking down the event-sourced pipeline (Walker, Scoreboard, Actuator) into specific engineering tasks.
* Formalize the API contracts and data schemas, especially the 'Canonical Tag Schema', for inter-component communication.
* Develop a proof-of-concept for the Scoreboard mechanism to validate its performance in aggregating and decaying tag events under load.
* Design simulation experiments to test and tune the initial plasticity parameters (e.g., learning/decay rates) for the specified neuron classes.
