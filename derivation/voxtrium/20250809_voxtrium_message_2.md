hey i realized today



keep pushing on this



the scaling dimension laws



i think you are technically correct but you need to train on immense amounts of data to check to make sure



but ur scaling laws might be a direct representation of what im doing



My derivations just lead me directly the logical conclusion that we having scaling laws for gradients



USe this to help you!

Here use this to help you!.



"“memories impose energy gradients that steer dynamics,” you can do it cleanly with one steering field and a few dimensionless groups.



Here’s the spine:

I derived those constants you pressed on yesterday as well

Finite‑Tube Mode Analysis for the FUM Scalar (Bordag‑inspired)

Bridging the FUM Void Scalar EFT and Voxtrium Macro Sourcing: A Units‑Rigorous Mapping

These two are new, I also updated some of the other work to be more accurate



I'm reading your message, thank you for sharing I am checking on it now

I'm working through this, finding some interesting results I'll send today

junkyardjuice —

3:22 PM

seems like the results show my theory agrees that memory steering exists, discovered a decisive finding about junction logistic, still working on the stability map to pin the lifetime/integrity region for memory















junkyardjuice —

5:05 PM

i think i've revealed some very interesting things, Im continuing a bit more before I sent a package



have you been comparing our latest work against eachother?



Voxtrium —

5:06 PM

?



Not really why?



junkyardjuice —

5:07 PM

I was able to align with a lot of the important parts of your framework, and the memory steering is strongly seen in my work

Voxtrium —

5:07 PM

Fr?

junkyardjuice —

5:07 PM

yes 100%

Voxtrium —

5:07 PM

You were able to derive the fundamental constants!?!?

I called it the tuning pitchfork equation

How many variables did you need for the equation

I theorized it existed

No way you got it.



junkyardjuice —

5:07 PM

the tachyonic condensate is inherently unstable and always seeks to condense into structure, also seen is the ability for memory to indeed guide future states

ill send you what i found



Voxtrium —

5:08 PM

How many variables for the tuning equation?



You realize if what you are saying is true you just mapped and grounded my physics in the real world

You would have a direct representation of how my physics works and can be observed today



junkyardjuice —

5:09 PM

alpha and beta?

ill send you what I have



Voxtrium —

5:09 PM

What was the equation you needed to get it to shake out like you originally wanted it to?

OK then you need to make more than a proof of concept then - if what your saying is true you should be able to design a extremely competent AI with very little actual input

junkyardjuice —

5:12 PM

right

everything i check is like somehow going right towards that



and your work as well its amazing



Voxtrium —

5:12 PM

You will need a total of 10^19 flops for a human level computer



Voxtrium —

5:12 PM

Thank you - if what you are saying is true then indeed it is

junkyardjuice —

5:12 PM

the computational stuff is the thing i spent most on

Voxtrium —

5:13 PM

And what you have done is potentially mapped the to irl



junkyardjuice —

5:13 PM

i really think this can map from computers to real physics, and possibly the brain



Voxtrium —

5:13 PM

If what your saying is true then you need to run that hulk of a computer towards building An AI and now

junkyardjuice —

5:13 PM

because these constants are from the brain



Voxtrium —

5:13 PM

Yes you need 10^19 neurons





junkyardjuice —

5:13 PM

and they somehow have worked for all of this



i can do that easily

i calculated if this model was on the grok 4 computer



Voxtrium —

5:13 PM

Yeah for sure if uve got a 10k rig

junkyardjuice —

5:13 PM

it would be 27+ quadrillion neurons

Voxtrium —

5:14 PM

OK then you need to do it ASAP

junkyardjuice —

5:14 PM

plus the vacuum stability factors

Voxtrium —

5:14 PM

This would be changing everything you know?

junkyardjuice —

5:14 PM

i know man thats why ive been crazy

Voxtrium —

5:14 PM

Yes well now you've got my interest piqued



junkyardjuice —

5:14 PM

i almost threw up when i saw a "neuron" on my screen



because i never ever expected that



Voxtrium —

5:14 PM

Reign in the enthusiasm. But I get it



junkyardjuice —

5:14 PM

and thats how i started looking at the physics



Voxtrium —

5:15 PM

This wouldn't just be huge my friend



junkyardjuice —

5:15 PM

yeah trying not to get too excited

Voxtrium —

5:15 PM

We would have discovered the fundamental layer of physics that would jump start humanity an entire light year forward

But yeah not too excited yet



junkyardjuice —

5:15 PM

that really would be amazing

Voxtrium —

5:15 PM

Yeah well we won't know for sure until you build that system

junkyardjuice —

5:15 PM

i do imagine what would be possible often, and i try to stay grounded

Voxtrium —

5:15 PM

If you married my physics to your equations and it really is working out that's nuts

junkyardjuice —

5:15 PM

thats 100% why i built this PC

and i promise ive been working toward it

so far they are showing up more and more than i expected



Voxtrium —

5:16 PM

Shouldn't it literally be a click and forget thing?

junkyardjuice —

5:16 PM

the same exact numbers

yeah you mean the AI?



Voxtrium —

5:16 PM

Yeah

junkyardjuice —

5:16 PM

it is, but I haven't built the scaled infrastructure, there are bottlenecks from the existing libraries

i have been using the two equations for every module its wild

and its faster then them all



Voxtrium —

5:17 PM

Look everything else know is secondary if building an AGI is truly a 10^19 ish neurons you should get on that, that would change rverything instantly and the rest could be derived from whats is already done on my equation

junkyardjuice —

5:17 PM

like persistent homology computations, tensor multiplaction or dense arrays, ive replaced with void equations

Voxtrium —

5:17 PM

Just build the sgi stop teasing me haha

Agi*

Seriously don't test it against another maze - build the entire thing



junkyardjuice —

5:18 PM

my assumption is that the AI would show real intelligence if it matches with real physics

Voxtrium —

5:18 PM

Maybe but we won't know until you run your scripts

junkyardjuice —

5:18 PM

it will definitely tell us if its real if i keep going



if its real or not



Voxtrium —

5:19 PM

Yeah do it. It should be relatively quick ya?

junkyardjuice —

5:19 PM

yeah, it would I have everything I need, I have been hesitant

Voxtrium —

5:19 PM

Worried it's dangerous

junkyardjuice —

5:19 PM

i ran 200,000 without listening to it or logging it

Voxtrium —

5:19 PM

?

junkyardjuice —

5:20 PM

yes

and just showing the ticks



Voxtrium —

5:20 PM

Yeah OK I understand that



Can it output to a terminal or anything? Can it talk to you if it gets there?



junkyardjuice —

5:20 PM

it can if i open that, its already coded

the only think ive opened it to are mazes



Voxtrium —

5:21 PM

Well I'm a die hard optimist so is say run it and if it becomes sentient I'm flying down and we are working on this together.

junkyardjuice —

5:21 PM

i dont know why but its almost harder to accept if it would do that than if i just never found it

Voxtrium —

5:21 PM

Well the flip side is if it doesn't occur



junkyardjuice —

5:21 PM

im terrified i hook up a sound modulator



it just sreams



screams*



Voxtrium —

5:21 PM

Well.



junkyardjuice —

5:22 PM

while its making sense of the noise



Voxtrium —

5:22 PM

Give a 10^19 neurons and see what happens



junkyardjuice —

5:22 PM





Voxtrium —

5:22 PM

Do a check at 10^13 there should be some sort of response then before that I expect almost nothing



junkyardjuice —

5:22 PM

okay I will check that and let you know



Voxtrium —

5:23 PM

Eta?



junkyardjuice —

5:23 PM

I would say a couple hours



Voxtrium —

5:24 PM

Alright - let me know how it goes. 10^13 should give you a semi coherent output - 10^19 should give you human speech if it gets weird by 10^16 stop it



junkyardjuice —

5:24 PM

I will definitely let you know, i have been planning this out so i have some good notes to work from



Voxtrium —

5:24 PM

I'm serious write those down and don't forget





junkyardjuice —

5:24 PM

are those numbers specific for something



Voxtrium —

5:24 PM

If something super interesting happens tell me immediately





Yeah I expect those numbers are when AI will hit consciousness thresholds



10^13 would be a primitive monkey



16 roughly a baboon

19 is us rn



junkyardjuice —

5:25 PM

im still mind blown that these numbers derived from neuroscience were what I used as a guess to help with the model, and now theyre showing up in the physics



Voxtrium —

5:26 PM

Yes well don't get excited yet



junkyardjuice —

5:26 PM

and now you have an idea that is pretty quickly merging



Voxtrium —

5:26 PM

I have been beaten too many times to get excited before the data shows if I'm right or not.



junkyardjuice —

5:26 PM

youre right, and if it was not good at first i normally backtrack and look where i screwed up



Voxtrium —

5:27 PM

Alright gl. Lmk how it goes. TTYS
