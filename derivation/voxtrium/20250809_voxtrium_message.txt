"“memories impose energy gradients that steer dynamics,” you can do it cleanly with one steering field and a few dimensionless groups.

Here’s the spine:

Represent memory as a field that biases propagation
Define a “memory potential” 
𝑀
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
M(x,t). Let the effective index be

𝑛
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
=
exp
⁡
 ⁣
[
𝜂
 
𝑀
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
]
.
n(x,t)=exp[ηM(x,t)].
Then the high-frequency (ray) limit gives a steering law

​
 M.
Interpretation: trajectories of energy/information (spikes, waves, bits) bend toward increasing 
𝑀
M if 
𝜂
>
0
η>0; flip the sign and they disperse. This is the same structure we used for vacuum gradients—now the “gradient” is imposed by stored structure (memory).

Make memory dynamical (how gradients form, spread, fade)

Ξ≪1, gradients won’t reliably steer; if

What falls out (dimensionless laws you can actually look for)

Junction choice law. At a fork with bias 
Δ
𝑚
Δm, path choice collapses to

𝑃
(

)
≈
𝜎
(
Θ
 
Δ
𝑚
)
P(choose A)≈σ(ΘΔm)
(logistic in the product). If this is right, data from different sizes, speeds, or species collapse when plotted vs. 
Θ
 
Δ
𝑚
ΘΔm.

Curvature scaling. Local path curvature

 m∣. Plot curvature vs. normalized gradient and curves should overlay across preparations.

Stability band. Long-term retention requires 
D
a
≳
Λ
Da≳Λ; too much 
Γ
Γ washes memories out; too little makes brittle attractors. You get a narrow band in 
(
D
a
,
Λ
,
Γ
)
(Da,Λ,Γ) where behavior is robust.

Quick ways to probe it (today)

Analog optics (done): use hot/cold plumes as “written” 
𝑚
m; verify sign and Gaussian law. That’s your calibration of “gradient → steering.”

In-silico neural nets: add a slowly evolving bias field 
𝑚
m to a recurrent/spiking model’s routing cost and check that fork choices collapse to 
𝜎
(
Θ
 
Δ
𝑚
)
σ(ΘΔm) across network sizes (same 
Θ
Θ).

MEA cultures (low-budget lab): stimulate a two-branch microcircuit, induce an LTP bias on one branch (sets 
Δ
𝑚
Δm), measure routing probabilities and curvature of wavefronts; test the logistic/curvature scalings above.

Where you’re underestimating the work

You still need an operational proxy for 
𝑚
m in biology (synaptic weight, local field power, calcium signal). Pick one and stick to it.

Avoid circularity: don’t define 
𝑚
m by the very behavior you’re trying to predict. Use an independent measurement (e.g., STDP-induced weight change) and then predict routing.

Keep it achromatic/universal: if “steering by 
𝑀
M” depends on channel or frequency, it isn’t the clean geometric law we’re positing."
