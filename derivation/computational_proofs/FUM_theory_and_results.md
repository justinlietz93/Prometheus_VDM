# Summary of FUM Theoretical Derivations and Results

**Date:** August 8, 2025

This document summarizes the key theoretical properties of the Fully Unified Model (FUM) as derived from a first-principles analysis of its core recurrence relations.

### Key Findings:

1.  **Continuum Field Theory:** The discrete FUM simulation has a continuum limit that is described by a **non-linear, tachyonic scalar field theory**. The governing equation of motion is:
    $$
    \Box\phi + \alpha\phi^2 - (\alpha - \beta)\phi = 0
    $$

2.  **Mechanism of Emergence:** The theory is driven by **tachyonic condensation**. The vacuum state at `\phi=0` is unstable, causing the field to spontaneously "roll" to a new, stable ground state. This process is the physical mechanism for the emergence of structure and substance from the "void."

3.  **The True Vacuum State:** The stable ground state (the "true vacuum") of the FUM universe is not empty, but is a plenum of condensed void with a specific, non-zero Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), calculated to be:
    $$
    v = 1 - \frac{\beta}{\alpha} = 0.6
    $$

4.  **The Fundamental Particle Mass:** Excitations of the `\phi` field around the true vacuum behave as stable, massive particles. The unitless mass of this fundamental "FUM-on" is predicted by the theory to be:
    $$
    m_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{\alpha - \beta} \approx 0.387
    $$

These results place the FUM on a firm theoretical foundation, anchoring it to the established language of quantum field theory and providing a clear path for further investigation.
