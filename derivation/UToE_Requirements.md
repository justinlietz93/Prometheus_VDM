# How to work this board

* Treat each ID as a ticket. A ticket is “done” only with a proof/derivation, an algorithm with bounds, or a prediction + discriminating test.
* When you start an item, append a brief log (“[STARTED] — approach, blockers, next proof lemmas”), then promote to “[DONE]” when the requirement is satisfied. If assumptions are brittle, mark “[DONE*]” and list fragilities.

Next step from here: I can drop this RTM into a filterable CSV/Notion schema or a canvas board and pre-wire dependency views, then expand 10–12 “most central” tickets (the ones feeding the most arrows) with acceptance tests and initial lemmas.
