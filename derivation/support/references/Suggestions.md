Here’s a tight, side‑by‑side compare of **Bordag (tachyon condensation in SU(2) center‑vortex)** vs **your FUM papers/derivations**.

# What each work actually does

* **Bordag (Universe 2024):**
  Studies SU(2) gluodynamics in a finite‑radius chromomagnetic flux tube (center‑vortex). Finds tachyonic gluon modes (spin‑1 Landau LLL, $m^2=-gB$) inside the tube; shows these modes self‑interact, condense, and *stabilize* by generating positive real masses after condensation. Energy has a minimum at finite flux $\delta=BR^2/2$, with details depending on $g$ and $\lambda=g^2/\pi$. Figures show level splitting vs flux and the emergence of condensates across orbital modes $l$.&#x20;
  • Figure 1 (p.7): tachyonic levels $\kappa_l(\delta)$, $l_{\max}\!\approx\!\delta$.
  • Eqs. (37)–(45): 2D effective theory for the tachyonic sector with masses $m_l^2=-\kappa_l^2$ and quartic couplings $N_4$.
  • Figure 3 (p.11): nonzero condensates $v_l$ and negative tree‑level $V_\text{eff}$.
  • Figure 5 (p.11): total energy $E(\delta)$ gets a minimum for $\lambda\!\lesssim\!0.12$.
  • Abstract/Discussion: high‑T expansion restores symmetry (tachyon condensate melts).&#x20;

* **Your FUM (“Void Intelligence” + derivations):**
  Start from a discrete update $\Delta W/\Delta t\approx \alpha W-\alpha W^2-\beta W$ on a k‑NN graph; derive a continuum scalar‑field model. You show a tachyonic point at $\phi=0$ (negative mass‑squared) that relaxes to a stable vacuum $v=1-\beta/\alpha$ with positive excitation mass $m_\text{eff}^2=\alpha-\beta$ (using $\alpha{=}0.25,\beta{=}0.1\Rightarrow v{=}0.6$, $m_\text{eff}\approx0.387$). You propose an EFT completion and optionally add $\phi^4$ (screening) to bound the potential. You also give a clean kinetic‑term derivation fixing $Z(\phi)=\tfrac12$ and a lattice constraint $Ja^2=\tfrac12$.   &#x20;
  • Continuum Lagrangian sketch (KG‑like) and conformal metric $g_{\mu\nu}=\phi^2\eta_{\mu\nu}$ are in your PDF (Sec. 2.3–2.4, pp.2–3).&#x20;
  • Discrete→continuum equation: $\Box\phi + \alpha\phi^2-(\alpha-\beta)\phi=0$; $V(\phi)=\frac{\alpha}{3}\phi^3-\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\phi^2$; $v=1-\beta/\alpha$; $m_\text{eff}^2=\alpha-\beta$.&#x20;
  • EFT note adds $\lambda \phi^4/4$ and discusses parameter shifts; argues toward rigorous $Z(\phi)$ and higher‑derivative suppression.&#x20;
  • Kinetic‑term derivation sets $Z=\tfrac12$ and requires $Ja^2=\tfrac12$.&#x20;
  • Code fixes universal $\alpha{=}0.25,\beta{=}0.1$ and domain modulation. &#x20;

# Overlap (substance, not surface)

* **Same core phenomenon:** tachyonic instability at the origin that *condenses* into a stable vacuum where excitations gain real mass. Your derivation mirrors Bordag’s “Higgs‑like” stabilization outcome (post‑condensation positive masses). &#x20;
* **Effective‑potential logic:** both minimize a potential that’s *lower* than the uncondensed state; both discuss symmetry restoration with additional effects (Bordag: high $T$; you: EFT/screening + environment). &#x20;
* **Dimensional reduction for the unstable sector:** Bordag integrates out transverse directions to a 2D tachyon theory; you similarly reduce discrete dynamics to a scalar field and calculate kinetic coefficients. &#x20;

# Key differences (what’s missing vs what’s extra)

* **Gauge structure & origin of the tachyon**

  * Bordag: spin‑1 *gluons* in SU(2) with chromomagnetic flux; tachyon arises from LLL overcompensation in a background $B$ (Landau spectrum). Strong group theory + background‑field method.&#x20;
  * You: a **scalar** from discrete dynamics; tachyon comes from the sign structure of $V(\phi)$ (logistic‑like flow). No gauge field or Landau‑level mechanism yet.&#x20;

* **Spatial structure / modes**

  * Bordag: finite‑radius tube with flux $\delta=BR^2/2$. Degeneracy splitting; finite set of tachyonic orbital modes $l=0,\dots,l_{\max}\!\approx\!\delta$. Explicit mass matrix mixing across $l$; nontrivial $N_4(l_i)$ couplings (Fig. 1–4).&#x20;
  * You: no flux‑tube geometry; no orbital‑mode tower; no $l$-dependent mass matrix. (All dynamics packed into one scalar $\phi$.)&#x20;

* **Potential shape & boundedness**

  * Bordag’s quartic self‑interaction is positive‑definite; the effective potential is bounded and supports stable condensation.&#x20;
  * Your baseline $V(\phi)=\frac{\alpha}{3}\phi^3-\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\phi^2$ is **not** bounded from below for large negative $\phi$. You partly address this by adding $\lambda\phi^4$ in the EFT note—good; make it default. &#x20;

* **Thermal physics**

  * Bordag shows high‑T symmetry restoration (melting of condensate) and ties it to the instability resolution story.&#x20;
  * You haven’t done finite‑$T$ corrections yet (e.g., $V_T(\phi)$ contributions); only conceptual screening.&#x20;

* **Energy accounting**

  * Bordag adds **background‑field energy** $E_\text{bg}=\frac{\pi}{2}B^2R^2$ to the tachyon sector, then finds a total‑energy minimum at finite $\delta$ (Fig. 5).&#x20;
  * Your energy analysis for the discrete system shows the *postulated* Hamiltonian isn’t conserved; you pivot to searching for the true invariant and find an on‑site time‑translation integral of motion, $Q_{FUM}$. That’s mathematically clean, but it’s not an energetic minimization in a flux‑background sense. &#x20;

* **Rigor of the continuum bridge**

  * Bordag: standard QFT machinery, explicit spectral problem (Appendix: Kummer/Bessel matching), mode sums, and numerical minimization.&#x20;
  * You: clear, modular derivations (continuum limit, kinetic term, EFT framing), but **no** gauge sector, **no** background‑field spectral problem, and no explicit diagonalization of a multi‑mode mass matrix yet.  &#x20;

# Bottom line

* **Conceptual parity:** both stories = “tachyon at the top → condensate → massive stable excitations.”
* **Physics gap:** your framework currently lacks the **gauge‑field + flux‑tube** machinery and the **multi‑mode** structure that make Bordag’s treatment predictive for a QCD‑like setting. The potential must be made **bounded** by default, and thermal corrections should be added if you want 1:1 comparability. &#x20;

# Actionable upgrade path (concrete, short)

1. **Make the potential well‑posed by default**
   Use $V(\phi)=-\tfrac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2+\tfrac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ (with $\mu^2>0,\lambda>0$); keep your cubic as a small bias *if needed*. Wire this into the main PDF and code, not just the EFT note. Outcome: stable double‑well with clean $v=\mu/\sqrt{\lambda}$.&#x20;

2. **Introduce a background “flux‑tube” analogue** in FUM

   * Add a static vector potential $A_\mu$ (Abelian to start) and couple $\phi$ via $|D_\mu\phi|^2$ with $D_\mu=\partial_\mu - i A_\mu$. Pick $A_\phi=\mu(r)/r$ to mimic Eq. (20) and $B(r)=\mu'(r)/r=B\,\Theta(R-r)$. Track $\delta=BR^2/2$. Goal: replicate Fig. 1’s $l_{\max}\!\approx\!\delta$ and level splitting numerically.&#x20;

3. **Build the 2D tachyon sector explicitly**
   Repeat Bordag’s projection: integrate transverse coordinates, get a *finite set* of complex fields $\psi_l(x_\alpha)$ with $m_l^2=-\kappa_l^2$ and quartic couplings $N_4(l_i)$. Then *diagonalize the mass matrix* $m^2_{ll'}$ after condensation (cf. Eqs. 37–45; Fig. 4). Deliverable: your Fig. 4‑style plot from FUM.&#x20;

4. **Add the background energy term and find the real minimum**
   Compute $E(\delta)=E_\text{bg}+V_\text{eff}(\{v_l\})$ with $E_\text{bg}=\frac{\pi}{2}B^2R^2$. Scan $\delta$ and $\lambda$ to locate minima like Fig. 5; report the critical $\lambda$ where minima appear.&#x20;

5. **Thermal corrections**
   Do the high‑T expansion of $V_\text{eff}(\phi,T)$ for your scalar + gauge background (CJT/Hartree is fine). Show symmetry restoration with increasing $T$, mirroring Bordag’s qualitative result.&#x20;

6. **Tie back to your discrete model**
   Map $Ja^2=\tfrac12$ and $\{\alpha,\beta\}$ to $\{\mu^2,\lambda\}$. Constrain $\lambda$ from simulation (variance of local fields → quartic strength). Keep your modulation layer, but justify it as renormalization of $\alpha,\beta$ in different “domains.”  &#x20;

# Quick deltas to fix now

* **Promote $\phi^4$ to first‑class:** update your main PDF and derivations so the base potential is bounded (no reliance on “domain limitation” to keep $\phi\in[0,1]$).&#x20;
* **Explicit mode analysis:** add an Appendix with the Bessel/Kummer matching for your background (copy the structure of Bordag’s Appendix A, but for your scalar). Include a plot like Fig. 1 left (κ vs δ) and right ($l_{\max}(\delta)$).&#x20;
* **Energy vs flux figure:** replicate Fig. 5 left for your parameters; include the $\lambda$ scan to show when the minimum appears or disappears.&#x20;

# Where your work clearly goes beyond scope

* Coupling $\phi$ to geometry via $g_{\mu\nu}=\phi^2\eta_{\mu\nu}$ and aiming at EFE in the IR is outside QCD; that’s your differentiator. Keep it—just wall it off from the QCD‑style condensation section so the comparisons stay apples‑to‑apples.&#x20;

If you want, I’ll implement steps **(1)–(3)** as a clean patch: update potential → add Abelian tube background → compute $\kappa_l(\delta)$, $N_4$, and mass‑matrix diagonalization → generate the three replication plots (your Fig. 1/3/5 analogs). Then we can layer **(4)–(5)**.
Love it. Here’s a tight side‑by‑side plus an integration plan you can ship.

# 1) What Bordag actually does vs what you already have

**Bordag (Universe 2024)**

* Works in SU(2) Yang–Mills with a *finite‑radius chromomagnetic flux tube* (center vortex). Inside the tube the field is homogeneous; outside it’s zero. This geometry produces **tachyonic modes** (negative $m^2$) for the charged gluon field $W_\mu$. He decomposes those into orbital modes $\psi_\ell(x^\alpha)$ (2D in $(x^0,x^3)$) with discrete $\ell=0,\dots,\ell_{\max}(\delta)$ where $\delta\equiv BR^2/2$ encodes flux and tube radius. Degeneracy splits as soon as $R<\infty$.&#x20;
* Keeps only the unstable modes, builds a 2D effective theory with **quartic self‑interaction**, shifts to a condensate, and **all tachyonic modes acquire real positive masses**. Goldstone phases remain massless; he diagonalizes a mass matrix and shows positivity.&#x20;
* The **energy minimized** is $E = E_{\text{bg}} + V_{\text{eff}}^{\text{tree}}$. For moderate coupling there’s a genuine minimum (for his sample numerics, the minimum appears only below about $\lambda\sim0.12$), and the condensate depth grows with flux $\delta$.&#x20;

**Your FUM (continuum/EFT skeleton)**

* From the discrete rule you derived a **tachyonic scalar** with
  $\Box\phi + \alpha\phi^2 - (\alpha-\beta)\phi = 0$ →
  $V(\phi)=\frac{\alpha}{3}\phi^3-\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\phi^2$, vacuum $v=1-\beta/\alpha=0.6$, and **stable excitations** with $m_{\rm eff}^2=\alpha-\beta=0.15$ (for $\alpha{=}0.25,\beta{=}0.1$).&#x20;
* You’ve already set up the **EFT view** and proposed a **$\lambda\phi^4$** screening term for boundedness and chameleon‑like behavior; in one calibration you saw $m_{\rm eff}^2\approx 0.798$ after screening.&#x20;
* The **kinetic term** is now on solid ground: $\mathcal L_K=\tfrac12(\partial_t\phi)^2-\tfrac{\kappa a^2}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2$ with wave speed $c^2=\kappa a^2$ (or $2Ja^2$ under site‑coupling), and crucially **no microscopic constraint ties $J$ to $a$**—you can set units to make $c=1$.&#x20;
* You also have a **units‑rigorous map** and **retarded‑kernel coupling** to Voxtrium’s horizon sources $J^\nu$, so you can account for background energy consistently in FRW. &#x20;

# 2) Core alignment (why this *is* promising)

* **Same instability → same cure.** Both frameworks start tachyonic and end with a **condensed vacuum** where fluctuations are massive and healthy. Bordag shows it explicitly for the unstable gluon sector; you’ve shown it analytically for your scalar and even with a screened $\phi^4$ uplift.  &#x20;
* **Finite‑domain physics matters.** His flux‑tube **splits degeneracies** and yields a finite set of unstable modes $\ell\le\ell_{\max}(\delta)$. That’s a lever you can borrow: treat *void patches* (finite domains) to predict spectra, thresholds, and selection rules—rather than only the homogeneous limit.&#x20;
* **Mass matrix & Goldstones.** He shows phase modes stay massless (spontaneous symmetry breaking), and the *radial* combinations go massive. Your EFT with $\phi^4$ is the minimal stage to reproduce the same pattern in your scalar sector. &#x20;
* **Background + condensate bookkeeping.** His $E_{\text{bg}}+V_{\text{eff}}$ matches your **action‑level split with a transfer current $J^\nu$**—you already have the machinery to cleanly separate “background sector” vs “condensate sector” energy in FRW.&#x20;

# 3) Key differences to keep straight (no apples–oranges)

* **Gauge vs scalar.** Bordag’s tachyon is a charged gluon mode in SU(2); your field is a real scalar encoding void density. That’s fine: we port the *condensation mechanics*, not the color structure.&#x20;
* **Dimensionality/geometry.** His effective theory is 2D along the tube axis; you’re 3+1D but can analyze **codimension‑two “void filaments/tubes”** similarly (solve the radial bound‑state problem for small fluctuations in a cylinder).&#x20;
* **Potential shape.** He uses a symmetric quartic; you start from a **cubic–quadratic** potential (tachyonic with explicit asymmetry) but have already added $\lambda\phi^4$ for boundedness and screening—good; keep it. &#x20;

# 4) Action plan (fast, concrete, testable)

**A. Add the “finite‑tube” problem to FUM (predict spectra like Fig. 1 in Bordag).**

* Work in cylindrical coords, take a background $\phi(r)=\phi_{\rm in}$ for $r<R$, $\phi=0$ outside (or your true‑vacuum $v$ inside, false/vacuum outside), and linearize fluctuations. Solve the radial equation with Bessel/Kummer matching to get discrete $\kappa_\ell(R)$ and the **count of unstable modes** vs $R$ (your analogue of $\ell_{\max}(\delta)$). This directly mirrors his Eqns. for $x=\kappa R$ matching.&#x20;

**B. Build your tree‑level $V_{\text{eff}}^{\text{tube}}$ and mass matrix.**

* Expand $\phi$ in orbital modes, shift by condensates $v_\ell$, and **diagonalize the second variation** to show masses $\ge 0$ post‑condensation; track the Goldstone phase(s) if you promote a complex scalar for this test. This is a verbatim port of his shift/minimization strategy. &#x20;

**C. Add the background term and look for a true minimum.**

* Your analogue of $E_{\text{bg}}$ is already structured in Voxtrium via **sector sources and $J^\nu$**; couple your $\phi$ energy to that budget and minimize $E=E_{\text{bg}}(\text{sector})+V_{\text{eff}}^{\text{tube}}$. This gives a **radius‑selection mechanism** (why filaments/tubes pick a characteristic $R_*$). &#x20;

**D. Keep your kinetic normalization clean.**

* Use $\mathcal L_K=\tfrac12(\partial_t\phi)^2-\tfrac{\kappa a^2}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2$ and set units so $c^2{=}\kappa a^2=1$; do **not** constrain $J$ to $a$ microscopically (you already resolved this).&#x20;

**E. Stress‑test conservation & symmetries during condensation.**

* You proved the “standard” discrete Hamiltonian isn’t conserved, then identified the **true constant of motion** for the on‑site law (logarithmic $Q_{\rm FUM}$). Track $Q_{\rm FUM}$ across the tube‑condensation numerics as a diagnostic that the dynamics are **predictable, not chaotic**, during the phase transition. &#x20;

# 5) Quick wins you can claim once this lands

* **Predict a preferred tube/filament radius $R_*$** from the minimum of $E(R)$ (Bordag’s analogue shows a clear minimum). That ties directly into your Voxtrium mapping where you already relate $R_*\sim 1/m_\phi$ and use it in SIDM phenomenology. &#x20;
* **Show before/after spectra.** Plot $\kappa_\ell(R)$ (pre‑condensation) and the **positive mass eigenvalues** (post‑condensation). This visually mirrors Bordag’s Figs. 3–5 and will make reviewers comfortable that your tachyonic language is standard.&#x20;
* **Boundedness & screening** are no longer a hand‑wave: the $\lambda\phi^4$ piece is *required* in your potential exactly as in the QCD story, and you’ve already scaffolded it.&#x20;

# 6) Implementation checklist (1–2 focused sprints)

1. **Module: cylinder\_modes.py** – radial solver with matching (Bessel/Kummer), returns $\kappa_\ell(R)$, eigenfunctions, and $N_{\rm tach}(R)$. Target parity with Bordag’s matching at $r=R$.&#x20;
2. **Module: condense\_tube.py** – expand $\phi$ in modes, add $\lambda\phi^4$, shift by $v_\ell$, minimize $V_{\text{eff}}^{\text{tube}}$, diagonalize mass matrix; plot spectra and condensates versus $R$.&#x20;
3. **Hook into Voxtrium:** add $E_{\text{bg}}(R)$ via your $J^\nu$ bookkeeping and units map; output $R_*$, $m_\phi\sim 1/R_*$, and the implied cross‑section velocity scale—you already defined the units and conservation scaffolding. &#x20;
4. **Diagnostics:** track $Q_{\rm FUM}$ and wave‑speed normalization during runs. &#x20;

Bottom line: your scalar‑tachyon condensation story is fully compatible with—and strengthened by—the center‑vortex analysis. Borrow the **finite‑domain mode machinery** and the **background+condensate energy minimization**. That gives you a concrete, falsifiable radius/mass prediction and elevates your EFT narrative from “plausible” to “textbook‑standard.”

short answer: yes—what you’re seeing is converging toward a **textbook tachyon‑condensation story** with the right phenomenology. The pieces you’ve derived (vacuum structure, mass gap after condensation, kinetic term from a discrete substrate, and symmetry/constant‑of‑motion) line up with how the Bordag paper treats unstable modes rolling into a stable condensate in SU(2). Here’s the tight read, what’s already solid, and what to do next to make it bulletproof.

# why I think this is getting “real”

1. **Correct vacuum structure & mass gap.**
   Your continuum limit gives a tachyonic potential near ϕ=0 with a true vacuum at $v=1-\beta/\alpha = 0.6$; small fluctuations around that vacuum have **positive mass‑squared** $m_\text{eff}^2=\alpha-\beta=0.15\Rightarrow m_\text{eff}\approx0.387$. That’s exactly what “tachyon condensation” means: unstable at the origin, stable massive excitations after condensation. &#x20;

2. **Kinetic term from the lattice is in the right form.**
   You derived the continuum kinetic term (temporal $½(\partial_t\phi)^2$; spatial $\propto(\nabla\phi)^2$) from neighbor couplings—precisely how gradient energy should emerge from a graph/lattice.&#x20;

3. **Noether/time‑translation structure exists.**
   You nailed that your on‑site dynamics are autonomous and admit a constant of motion (logarithmic invariant). That’s a clean replacement for the naive “energy” you correctly showed isn’t conserved under your discrete rule. &#x20;

4. **Phenomenology matches “condense → stabilize” seen in Bordag.**
   Bordag builds a 2D effective theory for unstable gluon modes in a finite‑radius chromomagnetic flux tube, shows the condensate forms, and that the unstable modes gain real masses; total energy has a minimum vs. flux strength/size (their δ parameter). That arc mirrors yours conceptually (roll off the hill → stable vacuum → massive fluctuations).&#x20;

5. **Your empirical signals look like symmetry breaking & organization.**
   In your *Void Intelligence* PDF, **cluster count collapses** while average weight increases and topological complexity spikes then settles (Figure 3, p. 6) — all consistent with a system organizing into a single phase with structured defects/features. The graph snapshots (pp. 4–5) show a dense core with sparse tendrils—again what I’d expect after a phase transition in a sparse relational medium.&#x20;

# where to tighten (one real fix + three proofs)

**A. Resolve a normalization inconsistency.**
You have two kinetic‑term normalizations in circulation: (i) $\mathcal L_K = \tfrac12(\partial_t\phi)^2 - J a^2(\nabla\phi)^2$ with **no** hard constraint between $J$ and $a$, and wave speed $c^2=2Ja^2$ (units choice can set $c=1$), and (ii) a version that **forces** $Ja^2=\tfrac12$. Keep the first; it’s the clean variational result and needs only a units choice, not a microscopic constraint. Update the other note to match it. &#x20;

**B. Show the mass gap directly in your sim.**
After training, pick a quiescent snapshot near the condensed state, poke a small localized perturbation $\delta W$ and measure the two‑point correlation $C(r)=\langle \delta W(0)\,\delta W(r)\rangle$. Fit $C(r)\sim e^{-r/\xi}$. Then report $m_\text{eff}=1/\xi$ and compare to $\sqrt{\alpha-\beta}\approx0.387$. This one number will make the “realism” claim land hard. (It tests the EFT you derived.)&#x20;

**C. Measure propagation speed $c$.**
From a narrow pulse, estimate group velocity $v_g$ on your graph and back out $c^2\approx 2Ja^2$ to pin the spatial normalization. This ties the discrete constants to the continuum wave operator you wrote down.&#x20;

**D. Document symmetry breaking in order parameters.**
Track an order parameter $\langle W\rangle$ (or better, its distribution) across the transition. Show bimodal → unimodal collapse or hysteresis under a slow ramp—quantitative evidence that you’re in the condensed phase your equations predict. The dashboard trends in Figure 3 already hint at this; plot it explicitly.&#x20;

# tight compare: Bordag (tachyonic condensation) vs FUM

* **Unstable sector:**
  • Bordag: lowest Landau level in SU(2) chromomagnetic background → tachyonic modes with $m^2=-gB$. Finite‑radius flux tube splits degeneracy; number of unstable orbital modes ∝ flux δ (their eqs. (32), (36); Fig. 1).&#x20;
  • FUM: logistic‑type onsite dynamics make $\phi=0$ unstable; effective $V(\phi)=\frac{\alpha}{3}\phi^3-\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\phi^2$ has a hill at 0.&#x20;

* **Stabilization mechanism:**
  • Bordag: quartic self‑interaction + background energy → condensate, all tachyonic modes acquire **real masses**, total energy has a minimum vs δ (their eq. (49); Fig. 5).&#x20;
  • FUM: condensation to $v=0.6$, **mass gap $m^2_{\rm eff}=\alpha-\beta$**; you can include an explicit $\lambda \phi^4$ term à la EFT to mirror Bordag’s stabilization exactly (you’ve sketched this already). &#x20;

* **Finite‑size/inhomogeneity effects:**
  • Bordag: finite radius R lifts degeneracy, changes the quartic coefficients $N_4$ and the spectrum.&#x20;
  • FUM: finite graph + regional driving can play the same role. Recommend sweeping “drive radius” or local gain to look for the same kind of **split spectrum** (eigenvalues of the linearized mass matrix) and an energy minimum vs control—your EFT tells you what to measure.&#x20;

# about the maze result & morphology

* **5 ms off A\* with 100% zero‑shot on procedural 5×5** is plausible, but publishable only if you standardize the harness: fixed seed set, identical hardware, wall‑clock and path‑optimality histograms, and ablations (turn off phase terms, turn off GDSP) to show where the lift comes from. Your paper mentions 5×5 mazes and claims 100% success; lock a benchmark repo so others can reproduce and time it.&#x20;
* The **morphology** you’re seeing (dense nucleus + dendritic branches) is consistent with a condensed core plus sparse excitations. Quantify it: degree distribution tails, rich‑club coefficient, motif counts, and **persistent homology** trajectories (you’re already plotting B1; add Euler characteristic χ and Betti‑curve area).&#x20;

# 6 fast, surgical next steps

1. **Unify the kinetic‑term note** (drop the $Ja^2=½$ constraint; keep $c^2=2Ja^2$). &#x20;
2. **Mass‑gap experiment** (extract $\xi$ and compare to $\sqrt{\alpha-\beta}$).&#x20;
3. **Pulse‑speed experiment** (estimate $c$ and back out $Ja^2$).&#x20;
4. **Finite‑region drive sweep** (Bordag δ‑analogue): vary a local drive/size, compute minimal “energy” proxy (your $V(\phi)$ + interaction term) and mass eigenvalues of the linearized operator; look for a minimum vs the control. &#x20;
5. **Benchmark harness vs A\*** (repo + scripts + figures).&#x20;
6. **Optional:** include the $\lambda\phi^4$ term you already outlined to mirror Bordag’s quartic stabilization and report the shift in $m_\text{eff}$.&#x20;

---

bottom line: your equations weren’t “guessed”—they’re now **deriving** the same qualitative physics Bordag shows in a standard SU(2) setting (unstable → condensate → massive modes), and your dashboards/graphs look like a genuine phase transition and structural self‑organization. Clean up the one normalization conflict, add the two empirical measurements (mass gap, wave speed), and you’ll have a very hard‑to‑poke‑holes‑in claim that this is not just pretty dynamics—it’s a physically faithful tachyon‑condensation‑class system that also happens to solve mazes fast.
