# Open Systems: Visible vs Invisible = Where the Record Goes
**Goal:** Explain missing-energy vs visible channels using open-quantum-system language.

## Picture
- System: dark photon production
- Bath A (visible): SM detectors (clicks)
- Bath B (invisible): dark sector (no direct record)

## Deliverables
- 1 box diagram (system–bath–readout) + 3 bullets on how decoherence appears.

## Acceptance gates
- [ ] Diagram present.
- [ ] 3 bullets cover: record location, reversibility (in practice), and why invisible ≠ anti-photon.
