Below is a focused **code ↔ physics fit audit** for `fum_rt`. I read the runtime you linked and your figures, and mapped them to the physics claims you’ve been developing. I call out what is *already aligned and strong*, where **code is missing physics**, where **physics is missing code hooks**, and what to implement next (with exact files/components).

---

## Top‑line verdict

* **Strong & already aligned:** your runtime enforces *void‑equation–driven* topology updates, measures topology natively, and gates dynamics by an intrinsic valence (SIE). Those are the right primitives for testing memory steering and junction behavior. ([GitHub][1])
* **Main fit gap:** the code uses a *logistic growth–minus–decay* update for the field $W$; your physics narratives and the tachyonic‑condensate mapping point to a **Z$_2$**‑symmetric *tachyonic (negative‑mass)* potential and curvature‑coupled terms. None of that is encoded yet. ([GitHub][2], [MDPI][3])
* **Observables gap:** your figures (retention/fidelity/SNR heatmaps, curvature scaling, junction logistic collapse) aren’t directly produced or checked by the runtime; there’s no in‑repo harness that computes those metrics.

---

## What is strong (keep and build on)

1. **Void‑guided structure formation:**

   * Structural affinity $S_{ij}=\max(0,\Delta \alpha_i)\max(0,\Delta \alpha_j)-\lambda_\omega|\Delta\omega_i-\Delta\omega_j|$ with top‑k per node; symmetric adjacency. This is a clear formal rule and matches your “use void equations for traversal/measuring” principle. ([GitHub][1])
2. **Traversal and measurement are void‑native:**

   * Walkers seed ∝ ReLU($\Delta\alpha$), transition weights use $S_{ij}$, and you publish compact observations for ADC. Good separation of introspection cost from $N$. ([GitHub][1])
3. **Topology metrics for pathology/phase change:**

   * Streaming B1 surrogate (cycles density + triangles/edge with EMA) and connectome entropy. These are exactly the kind of predictors that should correlate with your retention/fidelity curves and “junction collapse.” ([GitHub][4])
4. **Intrinsic drive (SIE) gating the dynamics:**

   * Signed reward blended from novelty/habituation/self‑benefit and emitted as $[0,1]$ valence; used as a multiplicative gate on field updates. That gives you a place to wire task feedback or novelty spikes into the physics as a time‑dependent coupling. ([GitHub][5])
5. **Scales to sparse:**

   * Sparse neighbor‑lists with alias sampling and native entropy path are ready for large‑N sweeps. ([GitHub][6])

---

## What’s missing **in code → from physics**

1. **No tachyonic (double‑well) field dynamics.**

   * Current update: $ \Delta W = \alpha W(1-W) - \beta W + \text{noise}$ (+ sine modulation). That is logistic, not tachyonic. Your mapping to Bordag (Universe 10, 38) and “condensation” stories imply a potential $V(\phi)=-\frac{\mu^2}{2}\phi^2+\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ with evolution $\dot\phi = -\partial_\phi V + \dots$. There is no $\phi\in\mathbb{R}$ nor a $Z_2$ symmetry in code (your $W\in[0,1]$). ([GitHub][2], [MDPI][3])

2. **No kinetic/gradient term or curvature coupling.**

   * Figures show **curvature scaling** and signed invariance. The runtime has no discrete Laplacian/gradient on $W$ (or $\phi$), so there’s no way for curvature or domain‑wall tension to affect dynamics. Traversal measures loops; it doesn’t bias evolution by curvature. ([GitHub][1])

3. **No explicit *junction* model/observable.**

   * Your “junction logistic collapse” result needs a detector for boundary crossing and a logistic fit of $P(A)$ vs. a control variable (e.g., $\Theta\,\Delta m$). There’s no junction event stream or fit pipeline in repo.

4. **Dimensionless control parameters in the figures are absent.**

   * Your grids use $\Gamma, \Lambda, D_a$. The runtime exposes `lambda_omega` and a handful of knobs, but there’s no declared mapping from $(\alpha,\beta,\text{noise},\text{dt})$ to $\Gamma$, nor from structural penalty to $\Lambda$, nor any $D_a$ analogue. ([GitHub][2])

5. **No retarded kernel / memory integral.**

   * “Memory steering” suggests time‑nonlocality. Code has EMAs (ZEMA, B1 smoothing) but the field update is Markovian (no convolution kernel $K(\tau)$). ([GitHub][7])

6. **No explicit conservation/continuity law.**

   * Your discrete conservation notes aren’t enforced. The runtime clips $W$ and prunes edges but doesn’t conserve any density/charge (no discrete Noether constraint).

7. **Time scaling and units are implicit.**

   * `dt=1/hz`, but `universal_void_dynamics` doesn’t multiply by `dt`. That makes physical time‑constant claims ambiguous when you sweep `hz`. ([GitHub][8])

8. **$\omega$ is not a state.**

   * $ \Delta\omega$ used in $S_{ij}$ is computed as $-\beta W$ each step; there is no stored $\omega$ field, so $|\Delta\omega_i-\Delta\omega_j|\propto|W_i-W_j|$ up to a scale. If $\omega$ is meant to be a genuine conjugate or phase‑like variable, it needs its own dynamics/storage. ([GitHub][1])

9. **Noise model is ad hoc.**

   * Uniform noise in $[-0.02,0.02]$ is injected without a physical interpretation (temperature, bath coupling, or measurement). ([GitHub][2])

10. **Observables in your plots are not in the repo.**

    * AUC/SNR/fidelity/retention, curvature estimator calibration, signed‑invariance sweeps—all missing as integrated metrics.

---

## What’s missing **in physics → from code**

To let the code fit the *strong* parts of your physics (and avoid over‑claiming), the write‑ups need to lock down:

1. **Clear nondimensionalization & parameter map.**

   * Define $\Gamma,\Lambda,D_a$ precisely and provide formulas to compute them from $\{\alpha,\beta,\lambda_\omega,\text{noise},dt\}$ and graph parameters (e.g., mean degree/top‑k). Then we can print these on every run. (Right now: no canonical mapping.)

2. **Pick the canonical field variable.**

   * If you want tachyonic condensation and $Z_2$ breaking, adopt a signed field $\phi\in\mathbb{R}$ (or $[-1,1]$) and state how $W$ (nonnegative) relates to $\phi$ (e.g., $W=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\phi)$). This informs data ranges and thresholds.

3. **Explicit junction model.**

   * Specify how your “junction” is prepared in discrete systems: two semi‑infinite domains, initial bias $\Delta m$, control $\Theta$. Define $P(A)$ operationally so the runtime can reproduce the logistic fit.

4. **Curvature definition on graphs.**

   * State your discrete curvature estimator (e.g., polyline curvature of walker paths, Ollivier–Ricci surrogate on active subgraph, or angle/turning measure) and its calibration protocol (you showed circular‑arc calibration; codify it).

5. **A conservation statement (even approximate).**

   * Identify the “quantity” you expect to be conserved (or slowly varying) and its discrete form. Then we can add a monotonicity/regression test.

6. **Paper correspondence.**

   * For the tachyonic mapping (Bordag, *Universe* 2024, 10, 38), call out which qualitative signatures you claim (e.g., symmetry breaking, domain walls, scaling of correlation length) and which you **don’t**. That keeps claims crisp. ([MDPI][3])

## Concrete implementation plan (minimal PR set)

> **Goal:** make the runtime produce your figures (or close correlates) with parameters that map to your theory. Changes are additive and localized.

### 1) Add a tachyonic field option

**File:** `fum_rt/core/void_dynamics_adapter.py`
Add an alternative updater with explicit `dt`:

```python
def tachyonic_dphi(W_or_phi, t, mu2=+0.5, lam=1.0, eta=0.1, dt=1.0, use_time_dynamics=True, domain_modulation=1.0, noise_std=0.0):
    # Treat input as φ in [-∞,∞]; if you keep W∈[0,1] then convert via φ = 2W-1
    phi = W_or_phi
    force = (+mu2*phi - lam*(phi**3)) * float(domain_modulation)
    if use_time_dynamics:
        force *= (1.0 + 0.5*np.sin(2*np.pi*F_REF*t))
    if noise_std > 0:
        force += np.random.normal(0.0, noise_std, size=phi.shape)
    return dt * (-eta*phi + force)  # simple friction + force
```

Expose a switch in `Nexus` to choose `universal_void_dynamics` vs. `tachyonic_dphi`, and if you stay with $W\in[0,1]$, use `phi = 2W-1` ↔ `W = (phi+1)/2`. **This gives you Z$_2$** breaking, domain walls, and a direct mapping to the paper. ([GitHub][2])

### 2) Add discrete gradient/curvature pressure

**File:** `fum_rt/core/connectome.py` (and sparse variant)
Add an optional Laplacian term on the field (graph Laplacian $L\phi$) to penalize curvature on active edges:

```python
def _laplacian_phi(self, phi):
    # Use active subgraph mask; sparse path: iterate adj
    ...
```

Then add `+ dt * kappa * (-Lphi)` into the field update. This is the hook that should drive your **curvature scaling** result when you vary $\Theta|\nabla m|$.

### 3) Make $\omega$ a real state (or remove it)

**File:** `connectome.py`
If $\omega$ is a genuine conjugate/phase, store an `omega` vector and evolve it (even linearly damped); keep $S_{ij}$ as designed. Otherwise, drop the $\omega$ notation and make the penalty explicitly $|W_i-W_j|$ to avoid implying a second field that doesn’t exist. ([GitHub][1])

### 4) Respect `dt` and define **dimensionless groups**

**Files:** `void_dynamics_adapter.py`, `nexus.py`
Multiply all deltas by `dt=1/hz`. Define and log at every tick:

$$
\Gamma=\frac{\alpha}{\beta},\qquad
\Lambda = \lambda_\omega \,\frac{\sigma_{\Delta\omega}}{\langle \text{ReLU}(\Delta\alpha)\rangle},\qquad
D_a = \text{noise (or Laplacian coeff.)}/\text{update scale}
$$

Print them into `events.jsonl` so your heatmaps can be reproduced from run logs. ([GitHub][8])

### 5) Add a **Memory Steering Harness** (metrics you plot)

**New file:** `fum_rt/experiments/memory_harness.py`
Implements:

* **Stimulus protocol** (symbol→group via your deterministic mapper) and **probe** trials.
* Metrics: **AUC\_end**, **SNR\_end**, **retention**, **fidelity\_end** exactly as in your figures; save numpy grids and heatmaps.
* A “junction” experiment that constructs two domains with controllable $\Delta m$ and fits $P(A)$ vs. $\Theta\,\Delta m$ (report $k,b,R^2$).

### 6) Add a **curvature estimator** used in the plots

**New file:** `fum_rt/analysis/curvature.py`

* Path curvature of traversal trajectories; replicate your circular‑arc calibration; add a unit test (3 radii).
* Compute “signed invariance” sweeps by flipping the sign of $\nabla m$ or $\Theta$ in the harness protocol and plotting mean curvature vs. $\Theta|\nabla m|$.

### 7) Noise with meaning

Expose a **temperature** parameter $T$ and use Gaussian noise with variance tied to $T$ (and print $T$ into logs). Replace hardcoded uniform noise. ([GitHub][2])

### 8) Keep your topology pipeline

No change required: **B1** meter and **ADC** are fine and should correlate with junction collapse and retention. Just log them alongside new metrics. ([GitHub][4])

## Minimal experiments to validate alignment (fast)

1. **SSB smoke test:** Start with random $\phi\approx 0$, $\mu^2>0$, small $T$. Verify bifurcation to $\pm v$; measure domain wall density vs. time. Expectation from tachyonic quench: rapid roll‑down, coarsening domains. ([MDPI][3])
2. **Junction logistic:** Prepare two domains with mean $\phi$ bias $\Delta m$; vary $\Theta$. Fit $P(A)$ curve; compare to your logistic (report $R^2$).
3. **Curvature scaling:** Turn on Laplacian term with coefficient $\kappa$; sweep $\Theta|\nabla m|$; reproduce linear trend in mean path curvature.
4. **Stability maps:** Grid over $(\Gamma,\Lambda,D_a)$ using the new definitions; re‑create your AUC/SNR/retention/fidelity canvases directly from logs.

---

## Open items I need from you

* **Definitions** you used for $\Gamma,\Lambda,D_a$ in the figures (exact formulas).
* **Your discrete curvature estimator** (confirm method and window).
* Whether **$\omega$** is a true conjugate variable or just a penalty proxy.
* The **junction setup** you used to create the logistic collapse plot (init, schedule, decision rule).

---

## Attribution

When we roll these into the combined derivation and runtime documentation, I’ll credit **Voxtrium** wherever his mapping/ideas are invoked and credit **you (Justin Lietz)** for the runtime design, memory‑steering experiments, and the connection to tachyonic condensation.

**Bottom line:** you’re one PR away from making the runtime speak the same language as your strongest physics claims. If you want, I’ll draft the `tachyonic_dphi` patch and the memory harness first; then we’ll wire curvature and the parameter logging so your heatmaps come straight out of the code.
