## Working Notes and Derivations

### Current Status: Phase I.1 - Establishing Core Axioms

#### Axiom 1: Field Variable Definition
**Statement:** The fundamental dynamical variable is a real scalar field $W: \mathbb{Z}^d \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}$, where:
- $W_i^n \equiv W(\mathbf{x}_i, t_n)$ represents the field value at lattice site $\mathbf{x}_i$ and time step $t_n$
- $\mathbf{x}_i = (i_1 a, i_2 a, \ldots, i_d a)$ with $\mathbf{i} = (i_1, \ldots, i_d) \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ and lattice spacing $a > 0$
- $t_n = n \Delta t$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and time step $\Delta t > 0$
- The field takes values in a bounded interval $W_i^n \in [-W_{\max}, W_{\max}]$ for physical stability

**Justification:** This establishes the discrete spacetime arena and ensures the field is well-defined with appropriate regularity for physical applications.

#### Axiom 2: Lattice Structure  
**Statement:** The spatial lattice is a regular cubic lattice $\Lambda = a \mathbb{Z}^d$ with:
- Dimension $d \geq 1$ (take $d = 3$ for physical applications)
- Uniform spacing $a > 0$ (lattice constant)
- Neighborhood structure: each site $i$ has $2d$ nearest neighbors $j \in N(i)$ where $|\mathbf{x}_j - \mathbf{x}_i| = a$

**Justification:** Cubic symmetry ensures isotropy in the continuum limit and provides the simplest non-trivial interaction structure for deriving spatial derivatives.

#### Axiom 3: Locality Principle
**Statement:** The dynamics at site $i$ and time $n$ depend only on:
1. The field value $W_i^n$ at the same site and time
2. The field values $W_j^n$ at neighboring sites $j \in N(i)$ at the same time  
3. The field value $W_i^{n-1}$ at the same site and previous time

**Justification:** This embodies causality and ensures the continuum limit will produce local field equations without instantaneous action-at-a-distance.

#### Axiom 4: Action Principle
**Statement:** The discrete dynamics are governed by a stationary action principle with action:
$$S = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \Delta t \sum_{i \in \Lambda} a^d \mathcal{L}_i^n$$
where the Lagrangian density per site is:
$$\mathcal{L}_i^n = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{W_i^{n+1} - W_i^n}{\Delta t}\right)^2 - \frac{J}{2}\sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j^n - W_i^n)^2 - V(W_i^n)$$

**Parameters:**
- $J > 0$: coupling strength between neighboring sites
- $V(W)$: on-site potential function (to be specified)

**Justification:** This is the minimal action containing kinetic energy (time derivatives), interaction energy (spatial derivatives), and potential energy, while respecting the locality and symmetry constraints.

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply Euler-Lagrange equations to derive the discrete field equations
2. Analyze the potential function $V(W)$ and its properties
3. Study conservation laws from symmetries of the action
4. Prepare for the continuum limit analysis

#### Derivation 1.2.1: Discrete Euler-Lagrange Equations

From the action principle (Axiom 4), the field equations are obtained by requiring $\delta S / \delta W_i^n = 0$ for all interior points.

**Calculation:**
The action is:
$$S = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \Delta t \sum_{i \in \Lambda} a^d \mathcal{L}_i^n$$

Taking the variation with respect to $W_i^n$:
$$\frac{\delta S}{\delta W_i^n} = \Delta t \cdot a^d \left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i^n}{\partial W_i^n} + \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i^{n-1}}{\partial W_i^n} + \sum_{j \in N(i)} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_j^n}{\partial W_i^n} \right]$$

**Term by term:**
1. From $\mathcal{L}_i^n$: $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i^n}{\partial W_i^n} = -\frac{1}{\Delta t^2}(W_i^{n+1} - W_i^n) + J \sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j^n - W_i^n) - V'(W_i^n)$

2. From $\mathcal{L}_i^{n-1}$: $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i^{n-1}}{\partial W_i^n} = \frac{1}{\Delta t^2}(W_i^n - W_i^{n-1})$

3. From neighbors: $\sum_{j \in N(i)} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_j^n}{\partial W_i^n} = -J \sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_i^n - W_j^n) = J \sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j^n - W_i^n)$

**Result:** The discrete field equation is:
$$\frac{W_i^{n+1} - 2W_i^n + W_i^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2} = J \sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j^n - W_i^n) - V'(W_i^n)$$

This is a **second-order difference equation in time**, naturally arising from the variational principle without any "promotion" from first-order dynamics.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Natural second-order structure**: No hand-waving needed to get $\partial_t^2$ terms
2. **Discrete Laplacian**: The sum $\sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j^n - W_i^n)$ is the discrete Laplacian operator
3. **Local force balance**: Time acceleration = spatial forces + potential forces
4. **Causality**: Future value $W_i^{n+1}$ depends only on present and past values

**Next:** Analyze the continuum limit of this equation.

#### Derivation 1.3.1: Exact Spatial Kinetic Prefactor

Following task 1.3, we need to derive the exact coefficient relating the discrete spatial interaction to the continuum $(\nabla\phi)^2$ term.

**Starting Point:** Discrete spatial interaction energy per site:
$$E_{\text{spatial},i} = \frac{J}{2}\sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j - W_i)^2$$

**For 3D Cubic Lattice:** Each site has 6 nearest neighbors at positions $\mathbf{x}_i \pm a \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\mu$ where $\mu \in \{1,2,3\}$.

**Taylor Expansion:** For a smooth field $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ in the continuum limit:
$$W_j = \phi(\mathbf{x}_i + a\hat{\mathbf{e}}_\mu) \approx \phi(\mathbf{x}_i) + a \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_\mu}\Big|_{\mathbf{x}_i} + \frac{a^2}{2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x_\mu^2}\Big|_{\mathbf{x}_i} + O(a^3)$$

**For each direction $\mu$:**
$$(W_{i+\mu} - W_i)^2 + (W_{i-\mu} - W_i)^2 = 2a^2 \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_\mu}\right)^2 + O(a^4)$$

**Summing over all directions:**
$$\sum_{j \in N(i)}(W_j - W_i)^2 = 2a^2 \sum_{\mu=1}^{3} \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_\mu}\right)^2 + O(a^4) = 2a^2 |\nabla \phi|^2 + O(a^4)$$

**Therefore:**
$$E_{\text{spatial},i} = \frac{J}{2} \cdot 2a^2 |\nabla \phi|^2 + O(a^4) = J a^2 |\nabla \phi|^2 + O(a^4)$$

**Coefficient Identification:** $c_{\text{lat}} = 2$ for the 3D cubic lattice.

**Continuum Spatial Kinetic Term:**
$$- \frac{J a^2}{2} \sum_i |\nabla \phi|^2 \cdot a^d \to -\frac{J a^2}{2} \int d^3x \, |\nabla \phi|^2$$

**Lorentz Invariance Condition:**
For the continuum action $S = \int d^4x \left[ \frac{1}{2}(\partial_t \phi)^2 - \frac{c^2}{2}|\nabla \phi|^2 - V(\phi) \right]$, we need $c^2 = J a^2$ to ensure Lorentz invariance with speed of light $c$.

**Result:** The exact spatial kinetic prefactor is:
$$\boxed{c^2 = 2J a^2}$$

This matches the result referenced in [void_dynamics_theory.md](foundations/void_dynamics_theory.md) and closes the "exact derivation" gap noted in [CORRECTIONS.md](CORRECTIONS.md#required-corrections).

## Notes on Theoretical Rigor

This development follows the principle of **constructive axiomatization**: each step must be:
1. **Logically necessary** - following from previous axioms/results
2. **Physically motivated** - connected to experimental or theoretical constraints  
3. **Mathematically precise** - with well-defined domains and convergence
4. **Falsifiable** - making testable predictions

The goal is to transform FUVDM from a phenomenological model into a rigorous field theory with clear foundations and predictions.
