Tags: [PLAUSIBLE], [STABILITY], [REPRODUCIBILITY], [NON-INTERFERENCE], [DOCS], [TESTS]

Summary
- Implemented a reproducible acceptance and verification framework for “memory steering”.
- Added acceptance document, harness script to generate logs/figures, and unit tests.

New Artifacts
- Doc: Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/memory_steering/memory_steering_acceptance_verification.md
- Script: Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/code/physics/memory_steering/memory_steering_acceptance.py
- Tests: Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/code/tests/physics/test_memory_steering.py
- Output locations (when run):
  - JSON logs → Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/code/outputs/logs/memory_steering/
  - Figures → Prometheus_FUVDM/derivation/code/outputs/figures/memory_steering/

Assumed Steering Law (to be reconciled if different)
- Discrete update with saturation:
  M_{t+1} = (1 − λ − g) M_t + g s_t + ξ_t, then clip to [0, 1]
  - Parameters: g > 0 (gain), λ > 0 (leak), ξ_t zero-mean noise (default 0).
  - Pole: p_pred = 1 − λ − g; stable for |p| < 1 (monotone if 0 ≤ p < 1).
  - Fixed point (constant s): M* = g s / (g + λ).
- Canonical mapping to W ≈ 0.6:
  - With s ≡ 1 and g = 1.5 λ ⇒ M* = 1.5/(1+1.5) = 0.6.

Acceptance Criteria (codified in harness)
1) Boundedness: no post-clamp excursions outside [0, 1].
2) Linear step response: |p_fit − p_pred| ≤ 0.02; |M_final − M*| ≤ 1e-2; overshoot ≤ 0.02.
3) Canonical void target: |M_final − 0.6| ≤ 0.02 for seeds {0,1,2}.
4) Noise suppression: ΔSNR_out−in ≥ 3 dB for default sinusoid+white noise.
5) Lyapunov monotonicity (constant s, no noise): frac(ΔF>0) ≤ 1%; median ΔF < 0.
6) Reproducibility: same seed ⇒ max_abs_diff ≤ 1e-12.

Harness Experiments
- Step response analysis with pole fit from log residuals.
- Canonical “void target = 0.6” multi-seed check (g = 1.5 λ, s ≡ 1).
- Noise suppression SNR comparison using parallel signal-only filter for ground truth.
- Boundedness under random s ∈ [0,1].
- Lyapunov ΔF_t diagnostics (constant s).
- Reproducibility strict equality test.

Run Instructions
- Activate venv:
  .\venv\scripts\activate
- Run acceptance harness:
  python -m Prometheus_FUVDM.derivation.code.physics.memory_steering.memory_steering_acceptance --seed 0 --steps 512 --g 0.12 --lam 0.08
- Inspect:
  - JSON log in code/outputs/logs/memory_steering/
  - Figures in code/outputs/figures/memory_steering/

Status
- [PLAUSIBLE] until harness run produces PASS across acceptance checks.
- Unit tests added:
  - Fixed point convergence
  - Boundedness with clamp
  - Reproducibility strict equality
  - Canonical 0.6 target

Validation Next Steps
- Execute harness to produce JSON/PNGs; record acceptance PASS/FAIL.
- If the real steering law differs from the assumed one-pole form, update:
  - p_pred, fixed point M*, and Lyapunov function, and adjust acceptance thresholds accordingly.

Risks / Assumptions
- Any nonlinearity/adaptivity in steering (f(s, M), time-varying gains, coupling terms) will alter p_pred and M*. Need exact formula (file path + lines) to refine analytic predictions.
- “Non-interference OFF” (g=0) is defined relative to the host system coupling. A bridge harness will be added once the integration location is confirmed.

Planned Bridge Work (follow-up)
- Add a host-bridge test (LBM or RD) to demonstrate:
  - OFF-mode non-interference: metrics within baseline tolerance.
  - ON-mode bounded influence: controlled changes with documented benefits.

Changelog
- 2025-08-21: Created acceptance doc, harness, and tests. Awaiting first run artifacts to tag criteria as [PROVEN].
