# Summary of FUM Theoretical Derivations and Results

**Date:** August 8, 2025

This document summarizes the key theoretical properties of the Fully Unified Model (FUM) as derived from a first-principles analysis of its core recurrence relations.

### Key Findings:

> Model class note: Canonical continuum description is reaction–diffusion (RD): ∂tφ = D∇²φ + rφ − uφ² [−λφ³ optional]. Second‑order EFT/KG claims are quarantined to [effective_field_theory_approach.md](Prometheus_VDM/derivation/effective_field_theory_approach.md:1). Any mass value is parameter‑dependent: m_eff = √(α−β).

1.  **Continuum Field Theory:** The discrete FUM simulation has a continuum limit that is described by a **non-linear, tachyonic scalar field theory**. The governing equation of motion is:
    $$
    \Box\phi + \alpha\phi^2 - (\alpha - \beta)\phi = 0
    $$

2.  **Mechanism of Emergence:** The theory is driven by **tachyonic condensation**. The vacuum state at `\phi=0` is unstable, causing the field to spontaneously "roll" to a new, stable ground state. This process is the physical mechanism for the emergence of structure and substance from the "void."

3.  **The True Vacuum State:** The stable ground state (the "true vacuum") of the FUM universe is not empty, but is a plenum of condensed void with a specific, non-zero Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), calculated to be:
    $$
    v = 1 - \frac{\beta}{\alpha} = 0.6
    $$

4.  **The Fundamental Particle Mass:** Excitations of the `\phi` field around the true vacuum behave as stable, massive particles. The unitless mass of this fundamental "FUM-on" is predicted by the theory to be:
    $$
    m_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{\alpha - \beta}
    $$
Note (scope): m_eff is an EFT concept (second-order-in-time). Numeric value depends on chosen (α,β). Avoid fixed numbers here; e.g., α=0.25, β=0.10 → 0.387; α=1, β=0.4 → 0.7746.

These results place the FUM on a firm theoretical foundation, anchoring it to the established language of quantum field theory and providing a clear path for further investigation.
