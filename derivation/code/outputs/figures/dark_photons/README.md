# Dark Photons Figures (Quarantine Notice)

Figures produced by engineering-only smoke runs are quarantined when executed without proposal approval.

- Excluded from KPIs and RESULTS per pre-registration policy.
- Look for matching JSON in logs with `policy.quarantined = true`.
- Approved analyses will generate non-quarantined figures after proposal approval.

See `derivation/dark_photons/PROPOSAL_Decoherence_Portals.md` for the checklist and approval status.
