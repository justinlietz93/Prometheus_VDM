# Dark Photons Logs (Quarantine Notice)

Engineering-only smoke artifacts are quarantined here when runs are executed without proposal approval using the `--allow-unapproved` flag.

- These logs are excluded from KPIs and RESULTS per pre-registration policy.
- Each JSON includes a `policy` block: `{ pre_registered: false, engineering_only: true, quarantined: true }`.
- Approved analyses will emit to the same domain without quarantine once the proposal is approved.

Refer to `derivation/dark_photons/PROPOSAL_Decoherence_Portals.md` for the pre-registration checklist and approval status.
