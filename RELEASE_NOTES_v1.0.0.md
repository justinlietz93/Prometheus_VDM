# Release Notes for v1.0.0

## Creating the GitHub Release

This file contains instructions for creating the GitHub release after this PR is merged.

### Steps to Create the Release

1. **Merge this PR** into the main/master branch

2. **Push the tag** (the tag has been created locally but needs to be pushed):
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Create a GitHub Release**:
   - Go to https://github.com/justinlietz93/Prometheus_VDM/releases/new
   - Select tag: `v1.0.0`
   - Release title: `v1.0.0 - FUM Real-Time Runtime Initial Release`
   - Copy the release notes from CHANGELOG.md

### Release Artifacts

The following can be attached to the release:
- Source code (automatically attached by GitHub)
- Distribution package: `prometheus_vdm-1.0.0.tar.gz` (can be built with `python -m build`)

### Building Distribution Package

```bash
# Install build tool
pip install build

# Build source and wheel distributions
python -m build

# Distributions will be in dist/ directory
# - prometheus_vdm-1.0.0.tar.gz (source)
# - prometheus_vdm-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl (wheel, if built)
```

### Publishing to PyPI (Optional)

To publish to PyPI (requires PyPI account and credentials):

```bash
# Install twine
pip install twine

# Upload to PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*

# Or upload to TestPyPI first
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

## Release Notes Content

**FUM Real-Time Runtime v1.0.0**

This is the initial release of the Prometheus VDM (FUM Real-Time Runtime), a sophisticated real-time void dynamics modulation system.

### Major Features

#### Core Runtime System
- **Real-time orchestration** at configurable Hz (default 10 Hz)
- **Universal Temporal Encoder (UTE)** for input processing
- **Universal Transduction Decoder (UTD)** for structured output generation
- **CoreEngine** with Connectome graph system using kNN-ish topology
- **Vectorized void dynamics** with domain-specific modulation support

#### Architecture
- Clean modular architecture with separation of concerns
- Runtime components: loop, telemetry, orchestrator, helpers
- Core components: engine, signals, connectome, metrics, memory
- I/O components: UTE, UTD, lexicon store
- Physics integration via void dynamics adapter

#### Interfaces
- **CLI interface**: `fum-nexus` command or `python -m fum_rt.run_nexus`
- **Web dashboard**: `fum-live` command or `python fum_live.py`
- Comprehensive command-line options for customization

#### Data Management
- **Checkpoint system** with HDF5 and NPZ fallback support
- **Event-driven metrics** with observation folding
- **Structured logging** via JSONL format
- **Run directories** with automatic timestamping

#### Visualization
- Dashboard and connectome visualization via matplotlib
- Real-time metrics updates
- Graph snapshot capabilities

#### Language Generation
- **Macro board** for structured output templates
- **Phrase bank** for rich sentence composition
- **Lexicon learning** from inputs and outputs
- Deterministic template filling

#### Developer Tools
- UTD event scanner (`tools/utd_event_scan.py`)
- Golden run parity harness (`tools/golden_run_parity.py`)
- Smoke emissions verifier (`tools/smoke_emissions.py`)
- Geometry bundle automation (`tools/geom_bundle_builder.py`)

### Supported Domains
- `quantum` - Quantum physics domain
- `standard_model` - Standard model physics
- `dark_matter` - Dark matter investigations
- `biology_consciousness` - Biological consciousness modeling
- `cosmogenesis` - Cosmological genesis simulations
- `higgs` - Higgs field dynamics

### Installation

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/justinlietz93/Prometheus_VDM.git
cd Prometheus_VDM
pip install -e .
```

#### From PyPI (Coming Soon)
```bash
pip install prometheus-vdm
```

### Quick Start

#### Web Dashboard
```bash
