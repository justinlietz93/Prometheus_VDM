### Organization
TODO Refactor codebase for maintainability
    FIXED: [JLietz][2025-08-14]Migrate dashboard and modularize frontend
    TODO Migrate core/ files into subfolders
    TODO [JLietz][Pending]Modularize nexus.py
    TODO Migrate these to fum_rt subfolders: 

    /mnt/ironwolf/git/Void_FUM_Private/Void_FUM_Private/Void_Unity_Proofs/tools/say_clean_view.py

    /mnt/ironwolf/git/Void_FUM_Private/Void_FUM_Private/Void_Unity_Proofs/tools/utd_event_scan.py

### Learning
TODO Improve user engagement, reward to not be released programmatically like traditional RL, the model to learn inherently that rewards are boosted when everyone is happy or when it does a good job
TODO Allow the user to give the model a small reward ad hoc for doing a good job
TODO Add a stimulus queue system for phased learning

### Physics
TODO Continue work on physics derivations
    TODO Implement physics simulations

### Misc
TODO Complete previous planned work
 - /mnt/ironwolf/git/Void_FUM_Private/Void_FUM_Private/Void_Unity_Proofs/from_physicist_agent
TODO Add GPU support

### Docs
TODO Update FUM Blueprints

### Bugs
