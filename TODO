    /mnt/ironwolf/git/Void_FUM_Private/Void_FUM_Private/Void_Unity_Proofs/tools/utd_event_scan.py

### Learning
TODO Improve user engagement, reward to not be released programmatically like traditional RL, the model to learn inherently that rewards are boosted when everyone is happy or when it does a good job
TODO Allow the user to give the model a small reward for doing a good job

### Physics
TODO Continue work on physics derivations
    TODO Implement physics simulations

### Misc
TODO Complete previous planned work
