## Generated Summary

The Fully Unified Void–Field Model (FUM), also known as the Void Dynamics Model (VDM) or Neuroca, is a cybernetic organism designed to achieve advanced intelligence through self-organization, guided by fundamental physical laws rather than traditional machine learning heuristics. Operating as an event-driven causal system, it learns and reasons zero-shot at runtime, with language serving as a communication interface. FUM adheres to an "inverse scaling law," prioritizing intelligence gains from denser explanations and fewer parameters over sheer scale, aiming for efficient operation on specialized hardware like neuromorphic/ARM boards, with a target of a billion neurons scaling through time and compaction.

**Theoretical Foundations and Core Dynamics**
At its core, the FUM’s existence is driven by Void Dynamics, a homeostatic process that minimizes `void_debt`—a systemic penalty for internal inefficiencies or paradoxes. The discrete FUM update rule, `ΔW_i/Δt ≈ (α-β)W_i - α W_i²` on a k-NN graph, describes an intrinsically dissipative system at the UV scale, where a naive discrete Hamiltonian is not conserved. However, the on-site dynamics possess an exact invariant `Q_FUM = t - (1/(α-β))ln|W/((α-β)-αW)|`, derived from time-translation invariance via Noether's Theorem, ensuring predictable individual node trajectories. Globally, a Lyapunov functional `L[W]` guarantees dissipative stability and convergence towards fixed points.

The discrete dynamics are rigorously bridged to two continuum models:
1.  **Reaction-Diffusion (RD) Branch:** The canonical leading-order model is `∂_t φ = D∇²φ + rφ - uφ²`, with `D = Ja²`, `r = α - β`, and `u = α`. This model's predictions for Fisher-KPP front speed and Linear Dispersion growth rates have been numerically validated with high accuracy.
2.  **Effective Field Theory (EFT)/Klein-Gordon (KG) Branch:** This provides a second-order time dynamics `∂_t²φ - c²∇²φ + V'(φ) = 0`, derived from an action-based continuum limit, where `c² ≡ 2Ja²`. A baseline bounded quartic potential `V(φ) = -½μ²φ² + (λ/4)φ⁴` is adopted for stability, with a cubic tilt `(γ/3)φ³` (mapping to `α` and `β`) to select a unique vacuum. The kinetic coefficient `Z(φ)` is proven to be a constant `½` at tree level, and higher-derivative operators are fixed and bounded by lattice dispersion, considered irrelevant lattice artifacts above the EFT cutoff.

The FUM scalar field is coupled to a causal source `J_φ` from local entropy production via a retarded kernel, embedded in an FRW background through the Voxtrium framework. This defines channel sources `Q_i` from the horizon entropy production rate `Ṡ_hor`, ensuring covariant energy-momentum conservation (`∇_μ(Σ_i T^μν_i) = 0`), consistency with `w_eff ≈ -1`, and small dark matter injection. Furthermore, a finite-radius tube analysis, mirroring Bordag's work, reveals tachyonic modes for `k=0` if `R > R_c⁽⁰⁾`. Quartic self-interaction stabilizes these instabilities, leading to condensates and an energy `E(R)` with a true minimum at a characteristic radius `R_*`. The system also exhibits fluid-like behavior, validated through Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulations (D2Q9 BGK model, Chapman-Enskog expansion), admitting a Navier-Stokes (NS) regime with derived kinematic viscosity `ν`, achieving high accuracy in Taylor-Green vortex and Lid-driven cavity flow benchmarks.

**Architecture and Event-Sourced Structural Plasticity (ESSP)**
The FUM's architecture prioritizes "void-faithfulness," meaning all computations and structural changes are derived solely from void dynamics, strictly prohibiting traditional ML constructs, global `O(N)` scans, or direct state manipulation outside an event-driven pipeline. Intelligence emerges from simple local rules, supported by heterogeneous specialization and subquadratic efficiency (`O(active_elements)`).
Structural modifications are managed by a unidirectional, decoupled pipeline: **Walker → Tag Event → Event Bus → Scoreboard → GDSP Actuator**.
*   **Walkers:** Read-only, lightweight "surveyors" (e.g., `ColdScout`, `HeatScout`, `ExcitationScout`, `InhibitionScout`, `VoidRayScout`, `MemoryRayScout`, `FrontierScout`, `CycleHunterScout`, `SentinelScout`) traverse local subgraphs, computing metrics (co-activity, metabolic load) and emitting `Tag` events for proposed changes. These scouts are "void-equation-aware," following potential drops or using memory-steering softmax for neighbor choice, operating within micro-budgets.
*   **Tag Events:** Atomic messages proposing single structural changes (e.g., `prune_synapse`, `cull_neuron`, `grow_synapse`, `neurogenesis`) with precise coordinates, reason, vote weight, and TTL.
*   **Event Bus:** A hierarchical, asynchronous message broker (Territory-scoped and Global).
*   **Scoreboard:** A stateful service aggregating `Tag` events into decaying vote counts, providing temporal integration and threshold-based decisions.
*   **GDSP Actuator (Goal-Directed Structural Plasticity):** The *sole* component with write access to its local connectome shard, executing surgical, CSR-safe operations (`PRUNE_BUDGET`, `GROW_BUDGET`, `CULL_BUDGET`) within strict per-tick budgets, eliminating dense matrix scans.

The connectome features diverse neuron classes (Relay, Inhibitory, Integrator, Purkinje-like) with distinct parameters (`k_target`, `eta`, `lambda_decay`) managed by a `PlasticityManager`. Synaptic weights (`w_ij`) are updated by Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (RE-VGSP), where eligibility traces are modulated by a global `sie.void_debt` signal and Phase-Locking Value (PLV), promoting use-it-or-lose-it behavior. Physiological triggers (e.g., `UseTracker` for low-use synapses, `ComplementTagger`/`Microglia` for weak synapses, `ExcitotoxicitySentinel`, `MetabolicAuditor`, `ApoptosisSentinel`) drive biologically analogous structural changes. A "Read/Write Asymmetry" ensures that high-level `GlobalSystem` (CPU) reads low-dimensional summary events (`O(1)`) while `Connectome` modifications (GPU) are executed as `O(1)` "surgical strikes" triggered by specific events.

**Decentralized Architecture and Scalability**
The FUM is decentralized into autonomous **Territories**, each managing a shard of the connectome. A **Control Plane** (Territory Manager, Policy Service, Topological Observer, Routing Coordination Service) orchestrates these territories, while the **Data Plane** consists of Territory Hosts with a Replicated Log Service (RLS) and Durable Snapshot Store (DSS) for host-loss proof crash recovery, ensuring high durability and low Recovery Time Objective (RTO). Inter-Territory operations utilize asynchronous protocols like the Saga-based Synaptic Handshake Protocol for eventual consistency, and Global Fragmentation & Repair mechanisms (probabilistic detection by the Topological Observer, negotiated growth, phased migration as escalation) for maintaining connectome integrity. Sharding for "Supernodes" uses a hybrid "Proxy-Delegation Model" with local, bounded-staleness caches. A hardened Phased Territory Migration Protocol enables live subgraph migration without "stop-the-world" pauses, with efficient mid-handoff crash recovery by directly consuming from the RLS. The system also supports Scheduled Storage Re-Platforming for adaptive storage migration based on long-term analysis, utilizing background replication, comprehensive shadowing, and performance validation before cutover. Cross-cutting concerns like client interaction, security (zero-trust, mTLS), and observability (distributed tracing, Prometheus metrics) are meticulously addressed.

**Cognitive Capabilities and Metacognition**
The FUM exhibits advanced cognitive capabilities, progressing through stages from pattern matching to abstract categorization, scientific reasoning, and philosophical contemplation.
*   **Self-Improvement Engine (SIE v2):** Acts as the "Executive" (Prefrontal Cortex), providing intrinsic motivation through a multi-objective valence signal (`total_reward`) derived from TD error, novelty, habituation, and Homeostatic Stability Index (HSI). The `sie.void_debt` signal modulates local plasticity and triggers neurogenesis, strategically placing new neurons at "structural frontiers" of "failure hotspots."
*   **Active Domain Cartography (ADC):** The "Cartographer" (Parietal Lobe), processes local observations from `Void Walkers` to incrementally update a global territory map (`O(#announcements)`), fostering self-awareness. Proposed enhancements include transforming passive territories into active, specialized functional organs by dynamically modifying local physics and learning rules.
*   **Autonomous Speech System:** Computes a "speak drive" `D_t` based on novelty, reward, de-habituation, and topological salience (`ΔB1`). Gating logic, including `z-score(ΔB1)` thresholds, determines when to emit concise, void-faithful messages (e.g., "Topology shift detected").
*   **Memory Steering:** A separate, slow memory field `M` (`∂_t M = γR - δM + κ∇²M`) generates a refractive index `n = exp(ηM)` that biases particle/ray trajectories, leading to a curvature law `r'' = η∇_⊥M`. This softmax-based routing (`P(i→j) ∝ exp(Θm_j)`) enables efficient exploration (trail repulsion) or consolidation (memory attraction), leading to predictable logistic curves at junctions.
*   **FUM Sandbox:** A temporary, isolated simulation engine for "offline," counterfactual reasoning. Triggered by SIE-detected cognitive states, it creates a small, temporary neuron cluster, loads relevant engrams (memories indexed by ANN search, `O(log E)`), simulates actions for `S` ticks (`O(k*S)`), and SIE evaluates outcomes to guide real-world action. It can predict "Terminal Instability" by sensing precursor signals (e.g., rapid `hsi_norm` drop, runaway hotspots).
*   **Global Brain States:** A computational analog of **sleep** is proposed for memory consolidation and synaptic homeostasis, triggered by "cognitive fatigue." This involves replaying significant engrams in the sandbox to accelerate RE-VGSP, followed by global synaptic downscaling.
*   **Rhythms and Neurogenesis:** The FUM inherently creates rhythms, with RE-VGSP learning enhanced by phase-locking. The system proposes active control of these rhythms via frequency-specific inhibitory walkers and SIE rewards for beneficial rhythmic states, leading to self-optimizing cognitive states.

**Implementation, Curriculum, and Roadmap**
The system is designed for AMD hardware (Threadripper CPU, Radeon XTX, Instinct MI100), prioritizing a sparse connectome (`O(N·k)`) with GPU acceleration (HIP kernels) and future FPGA implementation. A Universal Temporal Encoder/Decoder (UTE/UTD) handles I/O, using dual-path encoding for fidelity and adaptive semantic representations.
A phased curriculum ladder (P0-P4 or 0-9) guides cognitive development, with automatic promotion based on void-native metrics (e.g., `cohesion`, `vt_coverage`, `SIE valence`). Data curation for physics AI uses a hybrid strategy including synthetic toolkits (SymPy), AI-curated datasets, and raw observational data (Planck, SDSS, LIGO), embracing a "Software as Dataset" paradigm.
A working private pre-release of the VDM exists, with a roadmap including partner evaluation, an API sandbox, and a v1.0 release. Ongoing development focuses on hardening physics-to-code guards (e.g., `Q_FUM` spot-checks), refining memory dynamics, ensuring runner fairness, enhancing active-graph fidelity, improving map transport, completing scout functionalities, codifying CPU↔GPU splits, enhancing ADC territory detail, strengthening CI guard rails, and maintaining performance hygiene.

**Key Strengths and Open Items**
Strengths include the rigorous discrete-to-continuum EFT derivation, units-rigorous Voxtrium FRW sourcing, proven on-site `Q_FUM` invariant, a complete finite-tube tachyonic condensation pipeline, a compact memory steering model, and LBM-validated fluid dynamics. Open items involve completing higher-derivative EFT suppression, comprehensive hydrodynamic derivation (Chapman-Enskog), full numerical scanning for `R_*`, cosmological calibration, and further investigation into a global discrete conservation law beyond Lyapunov functions.
