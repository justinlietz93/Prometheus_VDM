# FUM Glossary

### A comprehensive glossary of terms and concepts used in the Fully Unified Model.

---

***Section A.***

**A.1. Adaptive Domain Clustering**
The FUM's bespoke, multi-faceted process for identifying emergent functional domains (territories) in the **Emergent Knowledge Graph (UKG)**. It uses a constrained search space (`k_min`, `max_k`), entropy-based adaptive scheduling, and reactive adaptation to manage territorial assignments efficiently and intelligently. It provides the discrete state representation (`S_t`) for the SIE and explicitly replaces older methods that relied on generic metrics like the silhouette score. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 7](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_7_Adaptive_Domain_Clustering.md))

**A.2. ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**
Conventional neural network models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) typically using rate-based units (like ReLU), fixed layered architectures, and learning rules like backpropagation. Contrasted with FUM's SNN approach. (See [Unit 1, Chapter 3](../Unit_1_Introduction_and_Concepts/Chapter_3_Design_Philosophy.md))

***Section C.***

**C.1. Catastrophic Forgetting**
The tendency for neural networks to abruptly lose previously learned knowledge when learning new information. FUM aims to mitigate this through mechanisms like synaptic decay, persistence tags, and structural plasticity stability checks. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 5](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_6_Practical_Considerations.md))

**C.2. Cohesion Check (CCC)**
Stage 1 of the EHTP diagnostic pipeline. A fast, global `O(N+M)` graph traversal algorithm that checks for network fragmentation by counting the number of disconnected components. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 8](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_8_Topological_Analysis.md))

**C.3. Control Impact**
The canonical metric (`control_FLOPs / system_FLOPs`) used in FUM to quantify the computational overhead of control mechanisms relative to the core simulation. The core design principle of "Emergence is Dominant" requires this value to remain negligible (`< 1e-5`). Replaces the deprecated term `complexity_ratio`. (See [Unit 1, Chapter 3](../Unit_1_Introduction_and_Concepts/Chapter_3_Design_Philosophy.md))

***Section D.***

**D.1. Deep TDA on Locus**
Stage 3 of the EHTP diagnostic pipeline. Expensive Topological Data Analysis (`O(n³)` where `n` is the size of the locus) is performed *only* on a small, suspect subgraph ("locus") to confirm the presence of inefficient cycles by measuring high B1 persistence. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 8](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_8_Topological_Analysis.md))

***Section E.***

**E.1. EHTP (Emergent Hierarchical Topology Probe)**
The FUM's primary introspection module for analyzing the structural health of the **Emergent Knowledge Graph (UKG)**. It operates as a three-stage diagnostic pipeline: 1) Cohesion Check (CCC), 2) Hierarchical Locus Search (HLS), and 3) Deep TDA on Locus. It identifies pathologies but does not perform repairs; it directs the GDSP to take action. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 8](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_8_Topological_Analysis.md))

**E.2. Eligibility Trace (`e_ij`)**
A synapse-specific, slower-decaying trace that accumulates the instantaneous **Plasticity Impulses (PI)** over time. It serves as the memory that allows a delayed global reward from the SIE to be correctly applied to recently active synapses. Its update rule is `e_ij(t) = gamma(PLV) * e_ij(t-1) + PI(t)`. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**E.3. Evolving LIF Neuron (ELIF)**
The FUM-specific neuron model. Based on Leaky Integrate-and-Fire dynamics, an ELIF is a dynamic entity that can be created, pruned, and whose connections evolve via GDSP and RE-VGSP, departing from the static nature of standard LIF neurons. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**E.4. Encoder / Encoding**
The mechanism in FUM that translates raw input data from various modalities (text, images, etc.) into the universal format of temporal spike trains processed by the SNN core, using methods like hierarchical or spike pattern encoding. (See [Unit 3, Chapter 1](../Unit_3_System_Dynamics_and_Behavior/Chapter_1_Unified_Temporal_Encoder.md))

**E.5. Exaptation (Analogue)**
A mechanism in FUM where existing, successful pathways or territories are duplicated or repurposed to initialize structures for new domains or functions, accelerating learning by leveraging established components. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**E.6. Excitatory Neuron / Synapse**
Neurons that, when firing, tend to increase the membrane potential of post-synaptic neurons (positive `w_ij`). FUM typically uses an 80:20 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**E.7. Expert-Level Mastery**
The target performance level for FUM, defined by high accuracy (>85-90%) on specific complex subsets of benchmarks (e.g., MATH, GPQA, HumanEval) and emergent validation tests after training on minimal data (80-300 inputs). (See [Unit 5, Chapter 1](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_1_Feasibility_and_Rationale.md))

***Section F.***

**F.1. Failure Impact Model**
A model using techniques like Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to quantify the potential negative consequences (impact) associated with different failure modes identified by the Probabilistic Failure Model. Informs risk assessment. (See [Unit 5, Chapter 5](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_5_Ethical_Framework_and_Societal_Context.md))

**F.2. Fault Tolerance**
The ability of the distributed FUM system to continue operating despite hardware failures (nodes, memory errors) or network partitions, achieved through mechanisms like consensus algorithms (Raft), redundancy, checkpointing, and ECC memory. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 4](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_4_Phase_4_Self-Exploration&Discovery.md.md))

**F.3. Fractal Dynamics / Fractal Intelligence Hypothesis**
The hypothesis that FUM's network activity and emergent structures will exhibit fractal properties (self-similarity across scales, e.g., a projected dimension of ~3.4 at the 5B neuron scale), which is theorized to correlate with enhanced reasoning depth and efficient information processing. (See [Unit 5, Chapter 3](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_3_The_Scaling_Dynamics_Model.md))

**F.4. Formal Methods / Guarantees**
Mathematical techniques (e.g., Lyapunov stability analysis, causal inference, model checking, spectral graph theory) applied, often with approximations, to provide theoretical confidence in FUM's stability, correctness, and alignment, complemented by brain-inspired validation metrics. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 4](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_4_Stability_Controls.md))

**F.5. FUM (Fully Unified Model)**
The specific AI architecture detailed in the documentation, characterized by its use of **Evolving LIF Neurons (ELIFs)**, **Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (VGSP)**, an emergent knowledge graph, **Synaptic Actuator (GDSP)**, a Self-Improvement Engine (SIE), and a focus on data efficiency and emergent intelligence. (See [Unit 1, Chapter 1](../Unit_1_Introduction_and_Concepts/Chapter_1_Introduction.md))

**F.6. Functional Specialization**
The process by which different groups of **ELIFs** or territories in FUM become selectively responsive to specific types of inputs or involved in particular computations, emerging primarily through activity-dependent self-organization (**VGSP**, inhibition, **GDSP**) potentially guided by weak initial connectivity priors. (See [Unit 3, Chapter 2](../Unit_3_System_Dynamics_and_Behavior/Chapter_2_Emergent_Behaviors.md))

***Section G.***

**G.1. Gaming / Reward Hacking**
The risk that the system learns to maximize the internal SIE reward signal through unintended means that don't correspond to desired external task performance. FUM employs safeguards like reward capping, normalization, ground truth injection, diversity monitoring, and robust reward design to prevent this. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**G.2. Generalization**
The ability of FUM to perform well on new, unseen inputs or tasks that differ from the training data, indicating a deeper understanding rather than just memorization. FUM's validation emphasizes testing generalization using emergent synthetic data and curated real-world examples. (See [Unit 5, Chapter 1](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_1_Feasibility_and_Rationale.md))

**G.3. GNN (Graph Neural Network)**
Neural network models designed to operate directly on graph-structured data. Contrasted with FUM, where the graph structure itself emerges from learning. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 5](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_5_The_Emergent_Knowledge_Graph.md))

**G.4. Synaptic Actuator (GDSP)**
The "Synaptic Actuator" or "surgical tool" of the FUM's self-modification system. It is the mechanism that performs physical changes to the network (growth, pruning, rewiring) based on a specific set of triggers from either the EHTP (for topological health) or the SIE (for performance). (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**G.5. Graph Entropy**
A global metric for assessing the structural health of the **Emergent Knowledge Graph (UKG)**. Low entropy can indicate an overly regular or pathologically constrained network structure, flagging the need for a more detailed review. The formula is `H(G) = -Σ(p_i * log(p_i))` where `p` is the degree distribution. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 8](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_8_Topological_Analysis.md))

***Section H.***

**H.1. Habituation (SIE component)**
A component of the `total_reward` signal that reduces the reward for frequently encountered input patterns, discouraging overfitting/memorization and promoting exploration of novel stimuli. Calculated based on similarity to recent inputs. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**H.2. Hardware Agnosticism**
The design principle that FUM's core algorithms (LIF, STDP, SIE) are independent of specific hardware, allowing potential implementation across various platforms, although specific optimizations might be used for development or deployment. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 6](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_6_The_Hybrid_Interface.md))

**H.3. Heterogeneity (Neuron Parameters)**
The intentional variation in parameters (like `tau_i`, `v_th_i`) across neurons, drawn from distributions at initialization. This mimics biological variability and enhances network dynamics by preventing excessive synchronization. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**H.4. Hierarchical Locus Search (HLS)**
Stage 2 of the EHTP diagnostic pipeline. If the graph is cohesive, this efficient process "zooms in" to find a small, suspect subgraph (a "locus") with a high **Pathology Score**, indicating a potential problem area for deeper analysis. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 8](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_8_Topological_Analysis.md))

**H.5. Homeostasis / Homeostatic Plasticity**
Biological principle of maintaining stable internal conditions. In FUM, refers to mechanisms like intrinsic plasticity (**ELIF** parameter adaptation) and synaptic scaling that regulate firing rates and synaptic strengths to keep network activity within a functional range. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 4](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_4_Stability_Controls.md))

**H.6. Homeostatic Stability Index (HSI)**
The canonical component of the SIE's `total_reward` signal that provides a reward for stable network operation. The formal implementation directly rewards the maintenance of firing rate variance near a target value: `HSI = 1 - |var(firing_rates) - target_var| / target_var`. Replaces all deprecated terms like `self_benefit`. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**H.7. Hybrid Architecture / Interface**
FUM's approach combining SNN simulation (often in custom kernels on one GPU type, e.g., 7900 XTX) for core neural dynamics with tensor-based computation (using libraries like PyTorch on another GPU type, e.g., MI100) for overhead tasks like SIE calculation, territorial analysis, and trace updates, linked via a defined data flow and synchronization protocol. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 6](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_6_The_Hybrid_Interface.md))

**H.8. Hyperparameter Tuning**
The process of finding optimal values for model parameters not learned directly from data (e.g., `eta`, `gamma`, SIE weights). FUM uses automated Bayesian optimization to tune sensitive hyperparameters. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 5](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_6_Practical_Considerations.md))

***Section I.***

**I.1. Impact (SIE component)**
A (now deprecated) component previously part of the `self_benefit` calculation, which is a simplified implementation of the **Homeostatic Stability Index (HSI)**. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**I.2. Inhibitory Neuron / Synapse / VGSP**
Neurons that decrease the membrane potential of post-synaptic neurons (negative `w_ij`). They play crucial roles in balancing excitation and stabilizing network activity. Inhibitory **VGSP** rules differ from excitatory ones to promote stability. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**I.3. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**
A theoretical framework used in FUM to quantify the degree of irreducible cause-effect power (Φ value) within the system, hypothesized to correlate with integrated reasoning capabilities (projected to be Φ ~20 bits at the 5B neuron scale). (See [Unit 5, Chapter 3](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_3_The_Scaling_Dynamics_Model.md))

**I.4. Input Scaling Factor**
A global factor (e.g., 0.1) used to scale down the magnitude of external input currents before they are applied to the network. This is a critical stability mechanism that prevents network hyperactivity. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**I.5. Initialization / Seed Sprinkling (Phase 1)**
The first phase of FUM training. Establishes a sparse, foundational network structure using minimal diverse data (80 inputs), k-NN based distance-biased connectivity, and weak random weights, preparing the network for further learning. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 1](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_1_Phase_1_Seed_Sprinkling.md))

**I.6. Intrinsic Plasticity**
A homeostatic mechanism where individual neuron parameters (like firing threshold `v_th_i` and membrane time constant `tau_i`) adapt based on the neuron's recent firing rate to maintain activity within a target range (e.g., 0.1-0.5 Hz). (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

***Section J.***

**J.1. Junk Data Injection Testing**

(See [Unit 5, Chapter 1](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_1_Feasibility_and_Rationale.md))

***Section K.***

**K.1. k-NN Initialization**
The process used to set the initial synaptic structure of the network, where each neuron is connected to its 'k' nearest spatial neighbors, creating a sparse graph with a strong local connectivity bias. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 1](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_1_Phase_1_Seed_Sprinkling.md))

**K.2. K-Means Clustering**
An algorithm used in FUM's Adaptive Domain Cartography to group neurons into `k` territories based on minimizing the distance between neurons' firing rate profiles and territory centroids. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 7](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_7_Adaptive_Domain_Clustering.md))

***Section L.***

**L.1. Lamarckian (Analogy)**
Refers to the aspect of FUM's learning where adaptations acquired through experience (via **VGSP** and **GDSP**) directly modify the network structure, resembling the (biologically largely discredited) theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics. FUM includes safeguards to ensure long-term adaptiveness. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**L.2. Latency**
The time delay in transmitting information (e.g., spikes) between different parts of the distributed FUM system. Managed through timestamp correction and potentially adaptive STDP windows. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 4](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_4_Phase_4_Self-Exploration&Discovery.md.md))

**L.3. LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire)**
The standard spiking neuron model that forms the basis for FUM's **Evolving LIF Neuron (ELIF)**. It models a neuron's membrane potential (`V`) integrating input and leaking charge over time. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**L.4. LLM (Large Language Model)**
Models like GPT-3/4, typically based on Transformer architectures, trained on massive text datasets using supervised learning (pre-training) and known for broad knowledge but high data/energy costs. Contrasted with FUM's approach. (See [Unit 1, Chapter 3](../Unit_1_Introduction_and_Concepts/Chapter_3_Design_Philosophy.md))

**L.5. Local Learning Rule**
A learning rule where synaptic weight changes depend only on information available locally at the synapse. **VGSP** is a hybrid rule that uses local information to create a potential change that is then validated by a global signal. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

***Section M.***

**M.1. Markov Property**
The assumption that the future state of a system depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. FUM uses territory IDs as an approximation of a Markov state for its TD learning value function. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**M.2. Memorization**
Learning specific input-output pairs from the training data without understanding the underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen data. FUM aims to avoid this through minimal data, SIE mechanisms (novelty, habituation), sparsity, and specific validation tests. (See [Unit 5, Chapter 1](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_1_Feasibility_and_Rationale.md))

**M.3. METIS**
A graph partitioning library used in FUM's scaling strategy to divide the neuron graph across distributed compute nodes while minimizing connections (communication) between partitions. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 4](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_4_Phase_4_Self-Exploration&Discovery.md.md))

**M.4. Minimal Data**
FUM's core philosophy and goal of achieving expert-level mastery using a very small number of training examples (target: 80-300 inputs), relying on efficient learning mechanisms (**VGSP**/SIE) and emergent generalization rather than massive datasets. (See [Unit 1, Chapter 1](../Unit_1_Introduction_and_Concepts/Chapter_1_Introduction.md))

**M.5. Modularity**
The property of a system being composed of distinct functional units (modules). In FUM, modularity emerges through Adaptive Domain Cartography, which identifies functionally specialized groups of neurons. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 7](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_7_Adaptive_Domain_Clustering.md))

***Section N.***

**N.1. Neuromodulation / Neuromodulatory Effects (Analogue)**
Biological process where chemicals (like dopamine) broadly influence neuronal activity and plasticity. FUM's SIE reward signal acts as a simplified global analogue, with enhancements like territory-specific rewards or distinct signal components (e.g., dopamine/acetylcholine proxies) aiming for more targeted, brain-inspired modulation. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**N.2. Neuron Parameters (`tau`, `v_th`, `v_reset`)**
Key parameters defining the behavior of an LIF neuron: `tau` (membrane time constant, affecting leak), `v_th` (firing threshold), and `v_reset` (resting potential after firing). FUM uses heterogeneous values for `tau` and `v_th`. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**N.3. Neutral Drift / Rewiring (Analogue)**
A mechanism inspired by genetic drift, allowing small, random synaptic changes or rewiring even when performance is stable, enabling exploration of functionally equivalent network configurations without immediate reward pressure. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**N.4. Novelty (SIE component)**
A component of the `total_reward` signal that rewards the processing of new, previously unseen input patterns (measured by similarity to recent inputs), encouraging exploration and adaptation. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

***Section O.***

**P.4. Persistence Tag**
A mechanism in FUM to protect important, consolidated knowledge. Synapses belonging to consistently high-reward pathways are marked as "persistent" (`persistent[i,j] = True`) and are exempted from weight-based pruning to balance stability and adaptability. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 4](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_4_Stability_Controls.md))

**P.5. Phase Transition Predictor**

**P.6. Phase 1 / 2 / 3 (Training)**
FUM's multi-phase training strategy: Phase 1 (Random Seed Sprinkling) builds a foundation from minimal data; Phase 2 (Homeostatically-Gated Tandem Curriculum) refines the network using a curriculum; Phase 3 (Continuous Self-Learning) involves autonomous operation and adaptation on continuous data streams. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 1](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_1_Phase_1_Seed_Sprinkling.md))

**P.7. Phase-Locking Value (PLV)**

In FUM, it is used as a proxy for "resonance" in the advanced **Resonance-Enhanced STDP** learning rule to dynamically modulate the learning stability. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**P.8. Plasticity Impulse (PI)**
The instantaneous potential for a synaptic weight change generated by a single, local spike-pair event. The PI is a discrete signal, not a memory. It is the value used to update the **Eligibility Trace (`e_ij`)** at each timestep. Replaces deprecated terms like `CRET_potential`.

(See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**P.10. Poisson Spike Generation**
The method used in FUM's Unified Temporal Encoder (UTE) (and potentially internally) to generate stochastic spike trains, where the probability of a spike occurring in a small time interval is proportional to a target firing rate (`f`). (See [Unit 3, Chapter 1](../Unit_3_System_Dynamics_and_Behavior/Chapter_1_Unified_Temporal_Encoder.md))

**P.11. Predictive Debugging Model**
A component of the Unified Debugging Framework that uses predictive methods (e.g., reinforcement learning) to anticipate potential failure modes based on network state, enabling proactive intervention. (See [Unit 4, Chapter 5](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_6_Practical_Considerations.md))

**P.12. Probabilistic Failure Model**
A model using techniques like Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of different failure modes occurring during FUM's development and scaling, informing risk assessment. (See [Unit 5, Chapter 5](../Unit_5_Validation_and_Analysis/Chapter_5_Ethical_Framework_and_Societal_Context.md))

**R.2. Rate Coding / Decoding**
Representing information by the average firing rate of neurons over a time window. Used as one method in FUM's Unified Temporal Encoder (UTE) and decoder, often for simpler inputs/outputs. (See [Unit 3, Chapter 1](../Unit_3_System_Dynamics_and_Behavior/Chapter_1_Unified_Temporal_Encoder.md))

**R.3. Refractory Period**
A brief period after a neuron fires during which it cannot fire again (or has reduced excitability). FUM implements a 5ms absolute refractory period in its LIF model and input encoding. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 1](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_1_The_Evolving_LIF_Neuron.md))

**R.4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. FUM uses RL principles via the SIE. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**R.5. Reliability**
The consistency and correctness of FUM's operations, including primitive formation, routing, and long-range dependencies. Ensured through mechanisms like SIE guidance, inhibition, stability controls, and validation. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 4](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_4_Stability_Controls.md))

**R.6. Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (RE-VGSP)**
The canonical, advanced, and computationally efficient (`O(N)`) implementation of FUM's learning principle. It uses an **Eligibility Trace** to solve temporal credit assignment, and its stability is dynamically modulated by network resonance (Phase-Locking Value), making learning both stable and efficient. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**R.7. Resource Efficiency Protocol**

**R.8. Reward Signal (`total_reward`, `r`)**
The feedback signal used in FUM's reinforcement learning. `r` is an immediate external reward (if available), while `total_reward` is the internally calculated SIE signal combining TD error, novelty, habituation, and the **HSI** to guide **VGSP**. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 3](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_3_The_Self_Improvement_Engine.md))

**R.9. ROCm / HIP**
AMD's software platform and C++ runtime API for GPU computing, used in FUM for writing and executing custom, high-performance kernels (e.g., for the LIF simulation loop) on AMD GPUs (like 7900 XTX, MI100). (See [Unit 2, Chapter 6](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_6_The_Hybrid_Interface.md))

**R.10. Routing (Graph)**
The process by which information (propagating spike activity) flows through the emergent knowledge graph along pathways determined by learned synaptic strengths (`w_ij`). (See [Unit 2, Chapter 5](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_5_The_Emergent_Knowledge_Graph.md))

***Section S.***

**T.4. Temporal Credit Assignment**
The challenge in reinforcement learning of assigning rewards or penalties to the specific past actions or events that contributed to the outcome, especially when there's a delay. FUM solves this by using the **Eligibility Trace (`e_ij`)**, which maintains a short-term memory of synaptic activity (Plasticity Impulses) that can be consolidated by a delayed global reward signal. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))

**T.5. Tensor-Based Computation**

(See [Unit 4, Chapter 5](../Unit_4_Lifecycle_Training_and_Scaling/Chapter_6_Practical_Considerations.md))

**U.4. Universal Temporal Encoder (UTE)**
The FUM's gateway for all information. It is a highly efficient transducer that converts any data type (symbolic, sequential, structural) into a dynamic, rhythmic spatio-temporal spike pattern that the SNN core can process. It uses direct, computationally cheap strategies, not complex transformations like an LLM. (See [Unit 3, Chapter 1](../Unit_3_System_Dynamics_and_Behavior/Chapter_1_Unified_Temporal_Encoder.md))

***Section V.***

**V.1. Validation (Emergent / Brain-Inspired)**

The term often refers to the "classic," computationally-heavy (`O(s^2)`) implementation used for early validation. (See [Unit 2, Chapter 2](../Unit_2_The_Architecture/Chapter_2_Neural_Plasticity.md))
