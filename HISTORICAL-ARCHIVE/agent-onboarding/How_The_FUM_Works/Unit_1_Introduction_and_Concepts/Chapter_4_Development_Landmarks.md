***Section A.***

**A.1. Landmark 1: Seed Network Formation**

**Status:** ✅ ACHIEVED (Phase 1)
**Progress Toward ASI:** 0-10%

**Justification:** This landmark is fully achieved. The Phase 1 run logs confirm that the initial network was built to specification and demonstrated the required baseline performance.
*   **Network Structure (VM1.1):** The logs show the network was initialized with ~96% sparsity via a k-NN algorithm and maintained the target 80/20 Excitatory/Inhibitory neuron ratio. The ELIF neuron parameters also match the specified distributions.
*   **Basic Responsiveness (VM1.2):** The system's ability to respond to stimuli is confirmed, with run logs tracking key metrics like "Response Latency," "Temporal Coherence," and "Response SNR".
*   **RE-VGSP Activity (VM1.3):** The logs clearly show that Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (RE-VGSP) is active, with a significant number of synapses being potentiated and depressed in response to stimuli.

**Core Capabilities:**
*   Basic **Evolving Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF)** neuron spike propagation with 1ms temporal resolution.
*   Initial **Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (RE-VGSP)** application with demonstrable synaptic weight changes ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 units.
*   Rudimentary spike responses to simple inputs spanning 5+ modalities (e.g., text, image, audio, touch, sensor data).
*   Architectural scale targeting 7 million neurons, with initial proof-of-concept (200 neurons) achieved in Phase 1. The initial ~96% sparsity was achieved via a k-NN algorithm, with the goal of achieving >99% brain-like sparsity through learning.

**Validation Milestones:**
*   **VM1.1 (Network Structure):**
    *   **Metric:** Initial sparse connectivity achieving ~4% density (~96% sparsity) via a k-NN(k=8) wiring algorithm. The long-term aspirational target density is <1% (>99% sparsity).
    *   **Metric:** Excitatory/Inhibitory (E/I) ratio stabilized at 80±2% excitatory and 20±2% inhibitory neurons, critical for dynamic stability.
    *   **Metric:** ELIF parameters (`tau`, `v_th`) distributed as N(20ms, 2ms²) for membrane time constant and N(-55mV, 2mV²) for threshold voltage, reflecting empirically validated biological ranges.
    *   **Justification:** Confidence in reaching the aspirational sparsity target is **very high**. The system's design, combining global weight decay with GDSP-driven pruning of weak synapses, inherently favors the elimination of unused connections. Early run logs confirm this, showing synaptic depression vastly exceeding potentiation, which validates that the network is built to carve out an efficient, hyper-sparse structure from its initial scaffold.
*   **VM1.2 (Basic Responsiveness):**
    *   **Metric:** Spike response selectivity with Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) > 3:1 for targeted stimuli, establishing a threshold for reliable signal detection.
    *   **Metric:** Temporal spike coherence, measured via cross-correlation, exceeding 0.3 within related neuron groups, the minimum for emergent clustering.
    *   **Metric:** Response latency below 100ms, required for real-time processing capabilities.
    *   **Justification:** These metrics validate basic information encoding and transmission, ensuring temporal precision essential for VGSP-driven learning.
*   **VM1.3 (VGSP Activity):**
    *   **Metric:** Hebbian weight changes observed in ≥60% of eligible synapses following correlated firing, the minimum for learning progression.
    *   **Metric:** VGSP curve alignment with theoretical function, achieving r² > 0.85, an empirically validated threshold for accuracy.
    *   **Metric:** Synaptic weight changes constrained within 0.01-0.1 units per event, a calibrated range for stability.

**ASI Significance:**
*   Establishes a foundational substrate capable of rudimentary information processing.
*   Exhibits minimal network-level cognition, primarily showcasing isolated neuronal mechanics.
*   Lays the groundwork for complex emergent behaviors, though intelligence manifestation remains negligible at this stage.

    *   **Metric:** Synaptic scaling normalizes excitatory input to 1.0 ± 0.1 per neuron.
    *   **Metric:** Inhibitory feedback reduces firing rate variance by >20%.
    *   **Justification:** Validates minimal control mechanisms for emergent stability, derived from neurobiological homeostasis principles.

**K.1. Resource Optimization Targets**

*   **Memory Efficiency:**
    *   **L1 Achievement Note:** The Milestone 1 VRAM target of <30GB was rendered moot; the entire simulation ran successfully within a shared 8GB system memory environment on integrated graphics, demonstrating exceptional baseline efficiency.
    *   **L2.5 Target:** <40GB VRAM with CSR format (9:1 compression) on target hardware.
    *   **L3.5 Target:** <50GB VRAM, FP16 computation / INT8 spike storage on target hardware.
    *   **L4.5-L5 Target:** Full 56GB VRAM, distributed utilization: 7900 XTX (ELIF) / MI100 (VGSP/SIE/UKG).

*   **Computational Efficiency (on Target Hardware):**
    *   **L1.5 Target:** VGSP update <1s, ELIF <100ms.
    *   **L2.5 Target:** VGSP <800ms, SIE <500ms.
    *   **L3.5 Target:** Inference <10s, SOC tuning reduces cascades by 50%.
    *   **L4.5 Target:** <7s inference, <1% GPU idle.
    *   **L5 Target:** <5s inference, <1ms SIE, <5% GPU idle.

**L.1. Critical System Optimization Methods**

*   **FP16 + Sparse Kernels:** Accelerated ELIF calculations via `neuron_kernel.hip` (L1-L5).
*   **GPU Specialization:** Dedicated roles (7900 XTX: ELIF inference, MI100: VGSP/learning) (L2.5-L5).
*   **Sparse Representations:** 95% network sparsity + CSR weight storage (9:1 compression) (L1-L5).
*   **SOC Management:** Predictive avalanche control, adaptive inhibition (L3.5-L5).
*   **Memory Management:** LRU caching, priority-based parameter server (L4-L5).

*Note: This landmark progression defines the developmental trajectory toward ASI on workstation hardware (7M neurons). Progress percentages represent conceptual milestones toward superintelligence rather than linear achievements. All validation metrics are derived from project documentation (How_It_Works sections, validation metrics, and Phase 3 implementation plans). Storage estimates (2-5TB, scaling to 10TB for ASI) reflect initial seed data, continuous learning streams, checkpoints, and logs, with 10TB anticipating full ASI scale.*
