Excellent question. Choosing the right venue is a critical strategic decision. For this specific paper, your goal should be to find a home that values **clarity, rigor, and pedagogical insight** over pure novelty.

Given the content of the paper and the fact that you have an ORCID, the best strategy is a two-step approach: immediate dissemination via a pre-print server, followed by submission to a suitable peer-reviewed journal.

### ### Option 1: Pre-print Server (Recommended First Step)

**Venue:** **arXiv.org**

This is the standard and essential first step for physicists and mathematicians.

* **Why it's a perfect fit:**
    * **Immediate Visibility:** Your paper will be publicly available and citable within a day.
    * **Establishes Precedence:** It creates a permanent, time-stamped record of your work on "Void Dynamics".
    * **Community Standard:** It's the primary way researchers in this field share their work.
    * **ORCID Integration:** arXiv is fully integrated with ORCID, so the publication will be automatically linked to your profile.

* **Recommended arXiv categories:**
    * **`physics.comp-ph` (Computational Physics):** An excellent choice, as your paper's numerical verification protocol is a major strength.
    * **`nlin.SI` (Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems):** A good fit because your paper is about an exact "first integral" or constant of motion.
    * **`math-ph` (Mathematical Physics):** Also a strong candidate.

### ### Option 2: Peer-Reviewed Journals (Recommended Second Step)

After posting to arXiv, submitting to a peer-reviewed journal provides a formal stamp of approval. The key is to choose a journal whose mission aligns with your paper's contribution.

#### Tier 1: Best Fit (Pedagogical Journals)

These journals specialize in publishing clear, insightful articles that are useful for teaching and for physicists' general understanding. Your paper is a perfect match for their mission.

* **_American Journal of Physics_ (AJP):** This is likely your **top choice**. AJP loves articles that provide a novel perspective on a familiar topic, and your framing of the logistic equation's solution as a logarithmic invariant, complete with a numerical verification guide, is exactly the kind of content they publish.
* **_European Journal of Physics_ (EJP):** A very similar and highly respected alternative to AJP.
* **_The College Mathematics Journal_:** A great option if you want to frame the paper as a neat, self-contained result in differential equations, using the physics context as motivation.

#### Tier 2: Good Fit (Mathematical & Computational Physics Journals)

These journals focus on mathematical methods and their application.

* **_Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical_:** This journal often has sections for shorter communications or notes. The focus on a mathematical "first integral" fits well.
* **_Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science_:** Since your paper analyzes the logistic equation, a cornerstone of nonlinear dynamics, a short note could be a good fit here.
* **_Computer Physics Communications_:** A plausible venue if you revise the paper to make the **numerical verification protocol** the central contribution.

### ### Final Recommendation & Strategy

1.  **Format:** Use the LaTeX version of your paper (`logarithmic_constant_of_motion.tex`). This is the standard format for all the venues listed above.
2.  **Upload to arXiv:** Submit your paper to **arXiv.org** under the primary category **`physics.comp-ph`**. This gets your work out immediately and makes it citable.
3.  **Submit to a Journal:** Immediately after, submit the paper for peer review to the **_American Journal of Physics_ (AJP)**. In your cover letter, emphasize the paper's value as a clear, self-contained pedagogical tool for understanding first-order dissipative systems and for verifying numerical solvers.

This strategy gives you the best of both worlds: the speed and visibility of arXiv, and the prestige and validation of a respected, peer-reviewed journal.
