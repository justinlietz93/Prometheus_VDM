Of course. Let's dive into how you can enhance your synaptic strength system. I've reviewed the code in your new jlietz/internals_migration branch, and you've already done some excellent refactoring by creating the fum_rt/core/neuroplasticity/ directory. This gives us the perfect place to build from.

Your current system is powerful, but it's homogeneous-every neuron learns using the same set of rules. The brain's strategy is heterogeneous plasticity, where different neurons have different learning rates and styles.

To implement this, I recommend creating a central "manager" for these diverse plasticity rules. This will keep your code clean and organized.

Step 1: Create a PlasticityManager
This new class will be responsible for storing the different learning parameters for each neuron class and providing them to the rest of the system.

You could create a new file: fum_rt/core/neuroplasticity/manager.py

Python

# In fum_rt/core/neuroplasticity/manager.py
import numpy as np

class PlasticityManager:
    """
    Manages heterogeneous plasticity parameters for different neuron classes.
    """
    def __init__(self, config: dict, neuron_types: np.ndarray):
        self.config = config
        self.neuron_types = neuron_types
        self.n_neurons = len(neuron_types)

        # Create parameter vectors based on neuron types
        self.eta = self._create_param_vector('eta')
        self.lambda_decay = self._create_param_vector('lambda_decay')
        # ... add other parameters like gamma, etc. ...

    def _create_param_vector(self, param_name: str) -> np.ndarray:
        """Builds a full-sized parameter vector from the class-based config."""
        param_vector = np.zeros(self.n_neurons, dtype=np.float32)
        for class_id, params in self.config.items():
            default_value = self.config.get('default', {}).get(param_name, 0.0)
            value = params.get(param_name, default_value)
            
            # In your new branch, neuron_types might be string names
            # You would map these strings to integer class_ids
            # For simplicity here, we assume integer class IDs
            class_indices = np.where(self.neuron_types == class_id)[0]
            param_vector[class_indices] = value
            
        return param_vector

This manager takes a configuration dictionary (defining the parameters for each class) and your array of neuron types, and it produces full-sized parameter vectors that can be used in your calculations.

Step 2: Integrate the PlasticityManager into Your Engine
Now, you would use this manager in your main engine (fum_rt/core/engine/core_engine.py in the new branch) to create and pass these parameter vectors to your plasticity functions.

Python

# In fum_rt/core/engine/core_engine.py

# (Import the new PlasticityManager)
from fum_rt.core.neuroplasticity.manager import PlasticityManager
from fum_rt.core.neuroplasticity.revgsp import apply_revgsp_vectorized # Assumes a new vectorized version

class CoreEngine:
    def __init__(self, cfg):
        # ... (other initializations) ...
        
        # Assume self.substrate.neuron_types exists
        
        # Define your heterogeneous parameters
        plasticity_config = {
            0: {'eta': 0.01, 'lambda_decay': 0.001},  # Class 0: 'Integrator' (slow, stable learning)
            1: {'eta': 0.05, 'lambda_decay': 0.0005}, # Class 1: 'Messenger' (fast, adaptive learning)
            'default': {'eta': 0.02, 'lambda_decay': 0.0008}
        }

        self.plasticity_manager = PlasticityManager(plasticity_config, self.substrate.neuron_types)

    def _step_learning(self, valence_signal: float):
        # ...
        
        # Get the parameter vectors for the current state
        eta_vec = self.plasticity_manager.eta
        lambda_decay_vec = self.plasticity_manager.lambda_decay
        
        # You would update your revgsp function to accept these vectors
        dW = apply_revgsp_vectorized(
            W=self.substrate.W,
            eligibility_traces=self.substrate.eligibility_traces,
            valence_signal=valence_signal,
            eta=eta_vec,
            lambda_decay=lambda_decay_vec
        )
        
        self.substrate.W = np.clip(self.substrate.W + dW, 0.0, 1.0)

Step 3: Update Your Plasticity Function
Finally, you would update your core plasticity function in fum_rt/core/neuroplasticity/revgsp.py to handle these vectors. The key is to use element-wise multiplication instead of scalar multiplication.

Python

# In fum_rt/core/neuroplasticity/revgsp.py

import numpy as np

def apply_revgsp_vectorized(W, eligibility_traces, valence_signal, eta, lambda_decay):
    """
    A vectorized version of RE-VGSP that uses per-neuron parameters.
    
    Args:
        W (np.ndarray): The neuron state vector.
        eligibility_traces (np.ndarray): The eligibility trace matrix.
        valence_signal (float): The global reward signal.
        eta (np.ndarray): The per-neuron learning rate vector.
        lambda_decay (np.ndarray): The per-neuron weight decay vector.
    """
    
    # The core logic remains the same, but now uses element-wise operations
    reinforcement = eta * valence_signal * eligibility_traces
    decay = lambda_decay[:, np.newaxis] * W  # Ensure decay vector aligns for broadcasting
    
    dW = np.sum(reinforcement, axis=0) - decay.T
    
    return dW.flatten()

By making these changes, you've created a much more powerful and bio-realistic system. Your FUM can now have neurons that are specialized not just in their connectivity (k), but also in their fundamental learning behavior. This is a huge step toward enabling more complex and nuanced emergent intelligence.
