1. Introduce Neuron "Classes" or "Types"
Instead of just having a state vector self.W, you would also have a self.neuron_types vector. Each neuron would be assigned a type (e.g., 'integrator', 'messenger', 'interneuron'). This assignment could be done at initialization and, as you suggested, could be dynamically changed by the Global System during growth and culling.

2. Give Classes Unique Properties
Each class would have its own set of base parameters. This is where you can computationally model the different roles:

Integrator Class (Purkinje-like):

High k value: To receive many inputs.

Slower Dynamics: Their internal state (W) might change more slowly, reflecting the integration of many signals over time.

High Δα potential: They would be prime candidates for generating creative potential because they synthesize so much information.

Messenger Class (Pyramidal-like):

Lower k value: Focused on fewer, more specific connections.

Faster Dynamics: Their state could change more rapidly to quickly propagate signals.

Different Void Affinity: Their S_ij calculation might favor connections over longer distances, modeling their role as long-range messengers.

3. Let the Global System Manage the Ecology
This is the most powerful part of your idea. Your Global System would become an "ecologist" for your connectome's diverse population.

The GrowthArbiter could become more sophisticated. Instead of just deciding to grow: 10, it could decide to grow: {'integrator': 8, 'messenger': 2} based on the overall state of the system. For example, if the system's hsi_norm is low because of chaotic signaling, the arbiter might decide to grow more inhibitory "interneurons" to stabilize the network.

This aligns perfectly with your principle of emergent intelligence. The system itself would learn, over time, what "ecology" of neuron types works best to solve problems, guided by the SIE's reward signal.

This strategy is both more powerful and potentially more efficient. By assigning specialized roles, you allow different parts of the network to become highly optimized for specific computational tasks, which is a hallmark of the brain's efficiency.
