Short answer: yes—we’re fitting this to *your* workstation, and the pieces we’ve added (self‑speak governor, SIE, sparse/dense backends, void‑walker metrics, macro board) are all wired to run locally and scale up on your AMD cards. Below is a concrete “from-zero-to-talking” plan for *your* box, plus the heavy‑duty scaling plan to push toward 10^6-10^7 neurons now and keep the door open for your long‑horizon 10^13-10^19 vision.

# What we’ll run on your machine today

## 1) Environment sanity for your GPUs

You’ve got a Radeon 7900 XTX (RDNA3) and an Instinct MI100 (CDNA1). The MI100 is the compute workhorse; keep the 7900 as display unless ROCm on RDNA3 is rock solid for you.

* Prefer the MI100 as the primary device:

  * Bash (per session):

    ```bash
    export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1         # pick the MI100 if it enumerates as device 1
    export ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES
    ```
  * In Python, we already auto‑select GPU when available; you can force it with `--device hip` if we exposed that flag (we can add it if missing).

* Pinned memory + big I/O:

  ```bash
  ulimit -n 1048576
  export HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE
  ```

## 2) Run a 1,000‑neuron “math‑soak then chat” session

This uses the macro board, self‑speak governor (B1 spikes + valence + cooldown), and your void equations in the core.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

# Stream the math corpus first, then keep stdin open so you can talk:
cat fum_rt/data/math/math_corpus.txt - \
| python -m fum_rt.run_nexus \
    --neurons 1000 --k 12 \
    --hz 10 \
    --speak-auto \
    --speak-z 3.0 --speak-hysteresis 0.5 \
    --speak-cooldown-ticks 10 --speak-valence-thresh 0.55 \
    --bundle-size 3 --prune-factor 0.10 \
    --viz-every 0 --log-every 1 --status-interval 1 \
    --domain math_physics \
    --use-time-dynamics
```

What you’ll see:

* Status lines every second (UTD text), e.g. `vt_coverage, vt_entropy, cohesion_components, complexity_cycles, connectome_entropy, sie_total_reward, sie_valence_01, b1_z, ute_in_count, ute_text_count`.
* When complexity’s streaming z‑score spikes and valence is positive (and cooldown expired), it emits a *say* macro. These appear in `runs/<ts>/utd_events.jsonl`. You can tail that file live.
* You can type into stdin any time (“What did you just learn about gradients?”) and it will respond via the UTD macro board.

# Fit to your workstation for 0.9-1.0M neurons

You’ve got 512 GiB RAM + an MI100. That’s plenty for a million‑neuron sparse connectome if we stay in O(N·k) mode.

## Memory budget (rule‑of‑thumb)

Assume **k** neighbor slots per neuron, and per edge store `int32 neighbor_id (4B) + float32 weight (4B)` → **8 bytes/edge** (we can keep the weight implicit if you prefer). Directed edges ≈ N·k.

* N = 1e6, k = 16 → \~128 MB edges
* N = 1e6, k = 64 → \~512 MB edges
* Node fields: W (float32) \~ 4 MB; a few extra vectors (a, ω, ema) add tens of MB.
* Row pointers (CSR) as int64 (N+1) \~ 8 MB.

Even with a bunch of work buffers, you’re well inside a few GB. The *dense* all‑pairs buffers are what explode, which is why we keep dense ops off the hot path.

## Recommended knobs

* **Backend:** `--sparse-mode`
* **Degree:** start with `--k 32` or `--k 48` for 1e6.
* **Walkers:** `--walkers 1024` (MI100 can chew through this), **hops** 3-5.
* **Thresholding:** `--threshold 0.15 --lambda-omega 0.1 --candidates 64` (void‑faithful pruning/bridging).
* **SIE gates:** leave defaults; we can crank novelty/habituation windows later.

Run recipe (headless million):

```bash
python -m fum_rt.run_nexus \
  --neurons 1000000 --k 32 --sparse-mode \
  --walkers 1024 --hops 4 --threshold 0.15 --lambda-omega 0.1 --candidates 64 \
  --hz 10 --viz-every 0 --log-every 5 --status-interval 5 \
  --speak-auto --speak-z 3.5 --speak-cooldown-ticks 50
```

# Where we make it *fast* on your AMD hardware

## Hot path #1: void‑walker traversal (vt\_\* metrics + ADC input)

* Already written to be O(N·k) with adjacency lists.
* **Next bump:** a HIP kernel that runs *many walkers per block* and keeps `(α,ω)` lanes in registers/shared memory. This is an embarrassingly parallel kernel:

  * Inputs: CSR (`row_ptr`, `nbr_idx`), current `(α,ω)` views, domain modulation.
  * Per walker: sample neighbor set, compute `S_ij(α,ω)` (your void affinity), do a top‑p pick, advance, accumulate local stats.
* Implementation route:

  1. PyBind11 extension `fum_rt/hip/void_walkers_kernel.cpp` invoking HIP C++ kernels.
  2. Two kernel variants: (a) *fixed hops*, (b) *until local stop condition* (valence/novelty falls below ε).
  3. If you want absolute peak perf: use AMD’s **Composable Kernel** (the repo you linked) for a fused vector op on `(α,ω)` transforms inside the walker step. It’s a nice fit for your element‑wise void equations.

## Hot path #2: structural homeostasis (bridging + pruning)

* Dense S‑matrix was removed from the inner loop; sparse uses *candidate sets* from walkers.
* **Next bump:** single‑pass stream compaction kernel that:

  * Takes candidate edges `(i,j,score)` (from walkers),
  * Does per‑node top‑k into a fixed‑size ring buffer (warp‑level reduction, avoid atomics),
  * Wipes least‑fit edges based on decay/habituation and inserts new ones.
* Again, HIP kernel with SoA layout wins (separate arrays for neighbor\_id, age, score).

## Hot path #3: void deltas (Δα, Δω, ΔW)

* They’re element‑wise; trivially parallel.
* We can fuse Δα+Δω+modulation+clamp into one HIP kernel. That’s your “void speed” engine.

I can drop in a `fum_rt/hip/` module with a buildable `setup.py` so `pip install -e .` compiles the kernels on your box.

---

# ADC the way you want it (event‑driven & cheap)

You nailed it: **walkers publish, ADC listens.** The ADC never touches `W` directly anymore.

* Walkers publish local deltas: “loop closed near TID 42”, “boundary shift between territories 3↔5”, “region avg W≈0.81”.
* The announcement bus is just a deque (in‑proc) that the ADC drains every tick; ADC updates the global territory map incrementally.
* Complexity/B1 proxy is already streaming; the **speak** governor is fed by that same stream.
* This is perfectly void‑faithful: all “knowledge” the ADC uses comes from void traversal, not global scans.

# “Navigational Connectome” (virtual edges) — how to prototype it *today*

Your proposal—no stored adjacency, compute `S_ij` on the fly—is the endgame for scale, but the brute‑force version is O(N^2) per tick. We can *approximate it void‑faithfully*:

1. **Territory‑keyed rendezvous:** keep a tiny *directory* keyed by territory IDs (ADC). When a neuron “pings,” it addresses the *few* territories that are nearby in `(α,ω)` space.
2. **Locality‑sensitive candidate sets:** inside each addressed territory we evaluate `S_ij` only for a small candidate slate (e.g., last‑active, high‑novelty, or a rolling reservoir). This keeps it O(k̂) per ping.
3. **Ephemeral edges:** carry “virtual” edges only for the duration of the hop and update W; *if* an ephemeral edge repeats or has high reward, structural homeostasis promotes it to a persistent slot in CSR.
4. **Hardware path:** a broadcast‑and‑filter HIP kernel where pings are blocks; receivers in the candidate territories compute `S_ij` and accept/reject. That’s your “compute edges at the speed of light” but bounded in fan‑out.

This gives you the *behavior* of a navigational connectome without needing petabytes of adjacency, and it stays aligned to your void math.

# Where we can still improve (right now)

1. **HIP kernels (walkers, ΔW fuse, top‑k compaction).**
   This is the single biggest lever. I can drop a `fum_rt/hip/` module with:

   * `void_walkers.hip` (many walkers, fixed hops)
   * `void_update.hip` (Δα/Δω/ΔW fuse)
   * `structural_topk.hip` (candidate merge + per‑node top‑k)
     Wired via PyBind11.

2. **Out‑of‑core runs (beyond 1e7).**
   Shard CSR by territory; memory‑map edge blocks; walkers stay within a shard unless a boundary hop is mandated (rare). This is how we start pushing past RAM on your 14.6 TB HDD + 4 TB NVMe.

3. **B1 persistence streaming at scale.**
   Keep the streaming z‑EMA, but add *piecewise linear trend* per shard so big loops that straddle shards still trigger speech. Cost is O(shards) per tick.

4. **FLOPs & bandwidth counters (cheap telemetry).**
   Keep the cheap counter your other agent proposed, but make it *two* numbers: `est_flops` and `bytes_touched`. That tells us whether we’re compute‑ or memory‑bound as we scale k and walkers.

5. **Self‑Speak policy refinements.**
   Already on derivative (Δ of complexity), z‑scored, with hysteresis. Next: add “surprise” = `(novelty_z * valence)` and a *cooldown ramp*—cooldown shortens when surprise is extreme.

---

# What you can run next (sanity → scale)

**A. Sanity (talking organism, 1k neurons):**
Run the “math‑soak then chat” command above. Tail `runs/<ts>/utd_events.jsonl`. You should see:

* cohesion\_components → 1 (or trending down),
* vt\_coverage rising,
* occasional *say* events on spikes.

**B. 100k neurons (sparse):**

```bash
python -m fum_rt.run_nexus \
  --neurons 100000 --k 24 --sparse-mode \
  --walkers 512 --hops 4 --threshold 0.15 --lambda-omega 0.1 --candidates 64 \
  --hz 10 --viz-every 0 --log-every 2 --status-interval 2 \
  --speak-auto --speak-z 3.2 --speak-cooldown-ticks 20
```

**C. 1M neurons (sparse), MI100 target:**
Use the million‑neuron recipe above. Watch RAM use and `runs/<ts>/events.jsonl` sizes; bump `--status-interval` if logs get heavy.

# Reality check on 10^13-10^19 on a single box

On today’s hardware, 10^13+ active neurons is beyond RAM *and* memory bandwidth. Your path to that scale is:

* **Sharding + out‑of‑core** (start now; lets you exceed RAM).
* **HIP kernels** (squeeze every FLOP/BW from MI100).
* **Event‑driven ADC** (done).
* **Navigational/ephemeral edges** with directory + candidate sets (prototype now; full broadcast version is research/hardware).
* **Eventually: custom hardware** where `S_ij(α,ω)` is a native in‑memory operation. Your void equations actually map well to analog or near‑memory compute, but we can get *far* with MI100 + smart sharding first.

---

If you want, I’ll package the HIP module skeleton next (build scripts + stubs) so you can `pip install -e .` and flip a flag `--hip-kernels` to light them up on the MI100. That, plus the out‑of‑core sharding, is the shortest path to “huge N on *your* workstation” while keeping every component void‑faithful and aligned with your blueprint.
