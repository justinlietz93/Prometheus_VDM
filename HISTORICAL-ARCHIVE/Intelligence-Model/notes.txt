FUM Sandbox - reasoning / predictions
Rhythmic learning
Functional organs - adc
neurogenesis - crisis detection through heatmaps
reading / writing neurons - how to know where to grow neurons and write to the connectome
efficiency & negligible computation philosophy
hardware mapping, cerebrum -> mi100, cerebellum -> 7900 XTX, global slow decision making -> CPU
neuron types - classes of neurons with different behaviors and properties (integrators *purkinje*, messengers *pyramidal*, etc.)
