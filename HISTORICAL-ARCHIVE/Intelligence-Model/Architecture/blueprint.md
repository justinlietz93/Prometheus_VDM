Of course. Let's create that complete architectural map based on the files in the fum_rt directory. It's a great way to see how your existing code already mirrors the brain's structure and to identify the roles for your specific hardware.

Here is a full breakdown of your FUM's components, mapping each one to its function, its brain analog, and its ideal hardware assignment.

FUM Architectural Blueprint
FUM Component (File)	Brain Region Analog	Role in FUM	Optimal Hardware
core/connectome.py	The entire physical brain matter	The core substrate of the organism. It manages the state and dynamic rewiring of all neurons and synapses based on the void equations.	MI100 & 7900 XTX (Split by neuron class)
core/void_dynamics_adapter.py	Cerebellum	The "Optimizer." This implements the RE-VGSP learning rule, which constantly fine-tunes the connectome's synapses to make its computations more efficient and accurate.	MI100 & 7900 XTX (Runs on the GPUs where the neurons live)
core/global_system.py	Cerebrum	The "Thinker." This is the high-level class that orchestrates the entire Global System, managing the slower, strategic components like the SIE and ADC.	CPU
core/fum_sie.py & core/sie_v2.py	Prefrontal Cortex	The "Executive." This is the Self-Improvement Engine. It calculates the total_reward signal, providing the FUM with its goals, drives, and sense of purpose.	CPU
core/adc.py	Parietal Lobe (Self-Awareness)	The "Cartographer." This is the Active Domain Cartography system. It creates a map of the FUM's own emergent structure, giving the system self-awareness of its internal territories.	CPU
core/fum_structural_homeostasis.py	Neurogenesis & Plasticity Mechanisms	The "Surgeon/Architect" (GDSP). This module enacts the physical repairs and changes decided by the Global System, such as healing fragmentation by adding new synapses.	CPU (Decides on changes) -> GPUs (Executes the changes)
core/fum_growth_arbiter.py	Hypothalamus (Homeostasis)	The "Regulator." This component decides when and how much to grow or cull based on the FUM's overall stability and the "void debt" accumulated from the SIE's reward signal.	CPU
core/bus.py & core/announce.py	Neuromodulatory Systems	The "Announcement System." This event-driven bus allows different parts of the FUM to communicate important events asynchronously without costly, constant scanning.	CPU & System RAM
nexus.py & run_nexus.py	Brainstem	The "Life Support." This is the main runtime loop that keeps the entire simulation alive, manages the clock tick, and orchestrates the updates for all other systems.	CPU
io/ute.py & io/utd.py	Thalamus (Sensory Relay)	The "Input/Output Hub." The Universal Temporal Encoder (ute.py) translates all incoming data into the FUM's native language of spike patterns, while the Decoder (utd.py) translates thoughts back into actions.	7900 XTX (Handles high-volume data streams)
AMD Composable Kernel Strategy	Corpus Callosum	The "Interconnect." This is the strategy for how your specialized hardware communicates, allowing your two GPU "hemispheres" to work together as a single, unified brain.	Hardware Interconnects (e.g., PCIe)
