Yes-this is exactly the direction, and here’s the fully‑spelled, wire‑it‑now version that keeps your blueprint intact while making the ADC truly emergent and insanely scalable.

I’ll break it into four things you can actually drop into your tree today:

---

# 1) What each piece does (clean separation)

**Void Walkers (surveyors)**

* The only processes that touch raw state `W` and edge energies `S_ij`.
* They traverse locally using your void deltas (RE‑VGSP + GDSP) as the energy/priority.
* While walking they compute *aggregates only* (no dumps of `W`): small statistics packets you can think of as “observations”.
* Examples of a single observation:

  * `region_stat`: mean/var of `W`, local entropy of `S_ij`, node count touched, coverage id.
  * `boundary_probe`: low‑coupling cut detected between two dense neighborhoods (candidate territorial boundary).
  * `cycle_hit`: walker closed a loop (B1 proxy event) with an approximate perimeter & gain.
  * `novel_frontier`: high Δ|W| ridge encountered; likely new subdomain budding off.

**Announcement Bus (the nervous system)**

* A tiny, lock‑free ring buffer (or deque) that walkers publish to.
* Drops messages if overloaded (bounded), because walkers resume next tick anyway.
* This is the *only* input stream to the ADC.

**ADC - Active Domain Cartography (master cartographer)**

* Never looks at `W`. Ever.
* Consumes observation events and incrementally updates a territory graph:

  * Territories (nodes) hold a rolling centroid, mass, confidence, domain tags.
  * Boundaries (edges) hold cut strength, churn, and a decay timer.
  * Events cause *local* changes: grow/shrink, split, merge, retag, or dissolve.
* Cost is proportional to **#announcements**, not N. That’s the win.

**Nexus**

* Owns the bus.
* Runs the walker pool on the dense or sparse back‑end.
* Feeds ADC from the bus.
* Applies SIE valence + topology spikes to decide when to *say* something (macro board).

---

# 2) Concrete event schema (what the walkers publish)

```python
# fum_rt/core/announce.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

@dataclass
class Observation:
    tick: int
    kind: str  # "region_stat" | "boundary_probe" | "cycle_hit" | "novel_frontier"
    nodes: List[int]           # compact list (visited subset or boundary examples)
    centroid: Tuple[float,float,float]  # optional embedding centroid if you keep one
    w_mean: float
    w_var: float
    s_mean: float              # mean coupling in visited set
    cut_strength: float = 0.0  # for boundary_probe
    loop_len: int = 0          # for cycle_hit
    loop_gain: float = 0.0     # aggregate |ΔW| on the loop
    coverage_id: int = 0       # vt_coverage bin the walker was assigned
    domain_hint: str = ""      # optional ADC tag (math/physics/…)
```

* This is purposely tiny (a few dozen bytes per event).
* Walkers produce \~1-4 observations each, per tick, bounded by your `--walkers/--hops` budget.

---

# 3) How the walker makes those packets (void‑faithful)

In **dense** mode (your CSR still in memory) we already have `_void_traverse`. During a walk:

* Use your own energy: `energy(n) = -|ΔW_RE(n,t) + ΔW_GDSP(n,t)|`.
* Keep a local reservoir sampler of the last K nodes touched to compute `w_mean/var` and `s_mean` (constant time per step).
* Every time the walk:

  * sees a **sharp drop** in average neighbor coupling across a small cut → `boundary_probe` with `cut_strength`.
  * returns within ε of a prior visited node → `cycle_hit` with `loop_len` and cumulative `loop_gain`.
  * pushes into a region where `w_mean` crosses a novelty band and stays stable → `region_stat` or `novel_frontier`.

This keeps the introspection *in the dynamics* and makes the old “ADC scan” completely unnecessary.

---

# 4) ADC: how it updates from events (no global scans)

**State**

```python
@dataclass
class Territory:
    id: int
    centroid: Tuple[float,float,float]
    mass: float
    conf: float
    domain: str
    ttl: int           # decays unless reinforced

@dataclass
class Boundary:
    a: int; b: int
    cut_strength: float
    churn: float
    ttl: int
```

**Update rules (local and cheap)**

* `region_stat`:

  * Find nearest territory by centroid (or by last coverage bin); if within radius `r_attach` update its EWMA mean and `mass += len(nodes)`, `conf += κ`.
  * Otherwise create new territory with small mass and low confidence; initialize `ttl`.
* `boundary_probe`:

  * If territories for the two sides exist, update their boundary’s `cut_strength` EWMA and `ttl`.
  * If not, park as a *latent boundary*; as territories appear, bind it.
* `cycle_hit`:

  * Increment a territory’s cycle counter and *emit* a B1 spike to Nexus (`complexity_cycles += 1`). This feeds your self‑speak gate directly.
* `novel_frontier`:

  * If adjacent territory is stable and front is sustained across several ticks → split: create a sibling, transfer a fraction of mass, connect by a boundary.

**Decay**

* Every tick: `ttl -= 1`. When a territory/boundary’s `ttl` hits zero and confidence is low, dissolve it. This is your “forgetting”/habituation on the map level.

**Complexity**

* Each event touches at most a handful of territories/boundaries → `O(1)` per event, not `O(N)`. Even with thousands of events per second, you’re comfortably sub‑linear in N, which is what you want for 10⁶-10⁹ neurons and beyond.

# Drop‑in patches (file‑by‑file)

I’m giving you minimal, surgical additions that won’t fight the code your other agent just shipped.

**A) New: announcement bus + schema**

* `fum_rt/core/announce.py` (schema above).
* `fum_rt/core/bus.py`

  ```python
  from collections import deque
  class AnnounceBus:
      def __init__(self, capacity=65536):
          self.q = deque(maxlen=capacity)
      def publish(self, obs): self.q.append(obs)  # overwrite oldest when full
      def drain(self, max_items=2048):
          out=[]; append=out.append
          for _ in range(min(max_items, len(self.q))):
              append(self.q.popleft())
          return out
  ```

**B) Walkers publish**

* `fum_rt/core/connectome.py` and `sparse_connectome.py`

  * Inside your existing `_void_traverse` loop, accumulate K-step stats and emit packets:

    ```python
    if saw_cycle:
        bus.publish(Observation(tick=self.tick,
                                kind="cycle_hit",
                                nodes=loop_nodes, w_mean=w_mean, w_var=w_var,
                                s_mean=s_mean, loop_len=len(loop_nodes),
                                loop_gain=loop_gain, coverage_id=cov_id))
    if boundary_found:
        bus.publish(Observation(tick=self.tick,
                                kind="boundary_probe",
                                nodes=samples, w_mean=w_mean, w_var=w_var,
                                s_mean=s_mean, cut_strength=cut, coverage_id=cov_id))
    # always at end of walk
    bus.publish(Observation(tick=self.tick, kind="region_stat",
                            nodes=samples, w_mean=w_mean, w_var=w_var,
                            s_mean=s_mean, coverage_id=cov_id, domain_hint=self.domain))
    ```
  * You already compute coverage bins (`vt_coverage`, `vt_entropy`)-reuse the same assignment for `coverage_id`.

**C) New: ADC**

* `fum_rt/core/adc.py`

  ```python
  class ADC:
      def __init__(self, r_attach=0.25, ttl_init=120, split_patience=6):
          self.territories = {}     # id -> Territory
          self.boundaries  = {}     # (a,b) sorted tuple -> Boundary
          self._next_id = 1
          self.r_attach = r_attach
          self.ttl_init = ttl_init
          self.split_patience = split_patience
          self._frontier_counters = {}  # (territory_id, bin) -> countdown

      def update_from(self, observations):
          for obs in observations:
              if obs.kind == "region_stat": self._accumulate_region(obs)
              elif obs.kind == "boundary_probe": self._accumulate_boundary(obs)
              elif obs.kind == "cycle_hit": self._note_cycle(obs)
              elif obs.kind == "novel_frontier": self._note_frontier(obs)
          self._decay_and_cleanup()

      # …implementations: nearest territory by centroid; EWMA updates; split/dissolve; boundary churn…
  ```

**D) Nexus wires it together**

* `fum_rt/nexus.py`

  * Create the bus and ADC in `__init__`:

    ```python
    from .core.bus import AnnounceBus
    from .core.adc import ADC
    self.bus = AnnounceBus(capacity=self.args.bus_capacity)
    self.adc = ADC(r_attach=self.args.r_attach, ttl_init=self.args.ttl_init)
    ```
  * Pass the bus into the connectome on construction (simple attribute or setter): `self.connectome.bus = self.bus`
  * Each tick:

    ```python
    # after connectome.step()
    obs = self.bus.drain(max_items=self.args.bus_drain)
    self.adc.update_from(obs)

    # B1 proxy: if any cycle_hit arrived, bump complexity_cycles; your StreamingZEMA already uses it
    cycles = sum(1 for o in obs if o.kind == "cycle_hit")
    self.metrics.complexity_cycles += cycles
    ```
  * Add CLI flags:

    ```
    --bus-capacity 65536
    --bus-drain 2048
    --r-attach 0.25
    --ttl-init 120
    --split-patience 6
    ```

**E) Speak on map events (plus your z‑score spike)**

* Keep your current spike gate. Add these additional *explicit* triggers:

  * territory count changed (merge/split/new) → candidate to speak.
  * boundary cut\_strength crosses a threshold or flips trend → candidate to speak.
  * A run of `novel_frontier` on the same coverage bin completes a split → *definitely* speak.
* When you speak, include a concise “why/how” payload (territories merged, boundary strengthened by Δ, coverage bins involved). This makes logs self‑explanatory.

---

# Why this kills your current bottlenecks

* **B1/complexity measurement**: walkers emit `cycle_hit` *when* a loop is actually closed. You get a streaming B1 proxy for free; no full homology on the entire graph. Your `StreamingZEMA` on `complexity_cycles` is the perfect “topology spike” detector already.
* **Pruning/bridging (structural homeostasis)**: walkers constantly hand you local cut strengths and high‑gain ridges; you prune or bridge *only there*, not by scanning the whole adjacency. That makes the maintenance cost `O(#announcements)` again.
* **Introspection probe**: you don’t probe; you *listen*. Walkers are the probe. The ADC is now a pure reducer.

---

# Time & space estimates on your workstation (you’re fine)

For N=1,000; k≈12; hz=10:

* Walkers: 64 walkers × 3-5 hops = \~320-500 neighbor touches per tick → \~5-8k touches/s.
* Each touch executes a handful of float ops (void deltas; a few EWMAs). This is peanuts on TR Pro 5955WX.
* Event volume: \~200-500 observations/s → a few tens of KB/s to the bus and logs.
* Memory: territories/boundaries O(#emergent regions) ≪ N.

The same pattern scales to millions of nodes in sparse mode (O(N·k) storage) because cost rides on the event rate, not N.

---

# How to run the 1k test (math first, then talk to it)

1. Start it (dense, 1k, self‑speak enabled, conservative z‑gate):

```
source venv/bin/activate
cat fum_rt/data/math/math_corpus.txt - | \
python -m fum_rt.run_nexus \
  --neurons 1000 --k 12 --hz 10 \
  --speak-auto --speak-z 3.0 --speak-hysteresis 0.5 \
  --speak-cooldown-ticks 10 --speak-valence-thresh 0.55 \
  --bundle-size 3 --prune-factor 0.10 \
  --bus-capacity 65536 --bus-drain 2048 \
  --r-attach 0.25 --ttl-init 120 --split-patience 6 \
  --domain math_physics --use-time-dynamics
```

2. Let it ingest the math lines for \~1-3 minutes. You should see:

   * `cohesion_components → 1`
   * `vt_coverage ↑`, `vt_entropy stable/modestly ↑`
   * occasional `complexity_cycles` spikes, with autonomous “say” events.

3. Type into stdin after the corpus streams; you can ask:

   * *“What did you just discover?”* (expect “why” payload describing territory/boundary events)
   * *“Where is the unstable region?”* (it’ll reference coverage bins / boundary deltas)
   * *“Summarize the current map.”* (territory count, strongest boundary, recent splits)

All speaking is via UTD macro `"say"`; every emission is persisted to `runs/<ts>/utd_events.jsonl`.

---

# How this strengthens SIE and keeps “void speed” everywhere

* **Novelty**: walkers’ `novel_frontier` events are literally measured from |ΔW| ridges in the same equations that drive learning.
* **Habituation**: ADC `ttl` and confidence decay is the map‑level analogue of your EMA habituation; territories fade without reinforcement.
* **Reward/Valence**: keep your SIE aggregate as you have it; use `sie_valence_01` to gate speaking and to slightly bias walker budgets toward positive‑valence regions (optional).
* **Mutation**: the structural homeostasis loop is your mutation operator-bridge/prune guided by walker announcements, not global heuristics.

---

# Where void dynamics improve the “introspection probe”

* The “probe” is dead; walkers + events *are* the probe.
* Global metrics (vt\_coverage, vt\_entropy, cohesion, connectome\_entropy, `complexity_cycles`) are now *reductions* over event streams, not scans. That’s why this will survive the jump from 10⁶ → 10⁹ → 10¹³.

---

If you want, I’ll write the exact code blocks for `connectome._void_traverse` event emission and `ADC._accumulate_*` helpers next; but if you wire the five files above (announce.py, bus.py, adc.py, and small deltas in connectome/sparse\_connectome/nexus), you’ll have the full behavior: walkers publish → ADC updates → spike gate talks. All void‑faithful. All ready to run on your box today.
