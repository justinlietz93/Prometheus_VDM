## üö´ Remove scheduler, keep scouts per‚Äëtick & event‚Äëdriven

**Non‚Äënegotiables**

* **No schedulers, no cadence.** Delete any `core/cortex/void_walkers/scheduler.py` (or similar). Do **not** add timers, cron‚Äëstyle loops, or `STRUCT_EVERY` gates for scouts or learners.
* **Scouts are read‚Äëonly, event producers.** They return events; they never write to the connectome or global arrays; no scans.
* **Learners are emergent‚Äëgated only.** GDSP/RevGSP must be triggered by signals (B1 spike, |TD|, fragmentation), not time.

**Immediate actions**

1. **Delete & denylist ‚Äúscheduler‚Äù**

   * Remove `core/cortex/void_walkers/scheduler.py` if added.
   * Add CI guard: fail if repo contains `void_walkers/scheduler.py` or imports `scheduler` in runtime/core.
   * Denylist tokens in CI (case‚Äëinsensitive): `STRUCT_EVERY|cron|every\s+\d+|schedule|scheduler`.

2. **Single per‚Äëtick invocation (stateless)**

   * In the runtime loop, call scouts **once per tick** with a **time/visit budget** and **drop‚Äëoldest** semantics.
   * **Do not** create an internal clock for scouts.

   ```python
   # fum_rt/runtime/loop.py  (inside the main tick)
   from time import perf_counter_ns
   MAX_US = int(os.getenv("SCOUT_BUDGET_US", "2000"))  # e.g., ‚â§1-3% of tick
   VISITS = int(os.getenv("SCOUT_VISITS", "16"))
   EDGES  = int(os.getenv("SCOUT_EDGES",  "8"))
   TTL    = int(os.getenv("SCOUT_TTL",    "64"))

   t0 = perf_counter_ns()
   all_events = []
   maps = engine.snapshot()  # or map snapshot you already expose
   for scout in self.scouts:               # pre‚Äëbuilt list from fa√ßade
       # time budget guard (per tick, not cadence)
       if (perf_counter_ns() - t0) // 1000 >= MAX_US:
           break
       ev = scout.step(
           connectome=self.connectome,
           maps=maps,
           budget={"visits": VISITS, "edges": EDGES, "ttl": TTL, "tick": step},
       )
       if ev:
           all_events.extend(ev)

   # publish the (possibly truncated) event batch
   if all_events:
       bus.publish_many(all_events)  # existing bounded FIFO; drop‚Äëoldest downstream
   ```

3. **Seeds from UTE + map heads (pulse‚Äëout from inputs)**

   * Pass recent UTE‚Äëhit indices to scouts via `budget["seeds"]` (or let `BaseScout` prefer `Heat/Exc`/`Cold` heads).
   * This matches your ‚Äúwalkers pulse from inputs‚Äù rule *without* any scheduler.

4. **Keep the four scouts + physics‚Äëaware variants**

   * `ColdScout`, `HeatScout`, `ExcitationScout`, `InhibitionScout` (event‚Äëdriven, uses reducer heads only).
   * Physics‚Äëaware options (read‚Äëonly, local signals only):

     * `VoidRayScout`: local œÜ difference bias (no scans; reads `phi[i]`, `phi[j]` only).
     * `MemoryRayScout`: steering softmax $P(i\!\to\!j)\propto e^{\Theta m_j}$ (uses slow memory map or heat proxy).
   * These honor your **steering by memory** law and junction logistic collapse while staying local and event‚Äëdriven.&#x20;

5. **Learners remain emergent**

   * **Do not** re‚Äëintroduce cadence for GDSP/RevGSP. Triggers: B1 spike, |TD| ‚â• `GDSP_TD_THRESH`, or fragmentation > 1.
   * If a trigger fires but context is thin, **bias scouts to that territory for one tick**, then allow the learner next tick (still event‚Äëonly).

6. **Physics guards (CI only, no runtime kill‚Äëswitch)**

   * Add `tests/guards/test_invariants.py` to spot‚Äëcheck the **on‚Äësite constant of motion**
     $Q_{\text{FUM}} = t - \frac{1}{\alpha-\beta}\ln\left|\frac{W}{(\alpha-\beta)-\alpha W}\right|$ over sampled nodes.
     Fail **CI** if 99th‚Äëpercentile drift exceeds tolerance; runtime only logs a warning counter.&#x20;
   * Add a steering A/B test (Œò>0 vs Œò=0) that verifies the predicted **junction logistic** behavior (collapse vs. $\Theta\Delta m$).&#x20;

7. **Guardrails against scans in scouts**

   * CI test ensures **no** `.toarray()`, `.tocsr()`, `csr`, `coo`, `networkx`, `synaptic_weights`, or global `W` enumeration in `core/cortex/void_walkers/*`.

**What‚Äôs OK vs not OK**

* ‚úÖ OK: per‚Äëtick *budget* (time/visits/edges/TTL), seeded by actual inputs/events; scout returns events; loop continues.
* ‚ùå NOT OK: ‚Äúmicro‚Äëscheduler‚Äù, timers, background threads, ‚Äúrun every N ticks‚Äù, cron‚Äëlike modules.

---

## Why (quick rationale you can share with the team)

* **Emergence**: scouts should *only* amplify information that‚Äôs already present on the bus; a scheduler injects an exogenous rhythm that biases outcomes.
* **Void‚Äëfaithful**: per‚Äëtick budgets respect your ‚Äúno scans, event‚Äëdriven‚Äù rule; the loop already provides the heartbeat.
* **Performance**: the per‚Äëtick guard caps cost deterministically; you get predictable latency at 10k\@10‚ÄØHz.

---

## Optional: name the acceptable module

If a helper file already exists, rename it to **`runner.py`** (stateless function `run_scouts_once(...)`), not `scheduler.py`, and call it **only** from the runtime tick. No timers inside.

---

## Keep the physics anchors (for CI & docs)

* **Steering by memory** ‚Üí scout neighbor softmax $P(i\to j)\propto e^{\Theta m_j}$; junction choice collapses vs. $\Theta\Delta m$.&#x20;
* **On‚Äësite invariant $Q_{\text{FUM}}$** for sampled nodes (audit‚Äëonly; no runtime stop).&#x20;

---

### TL;DR the agent can‚Äôt miss

> **Delete any ‚Äúscheduler‚Äù.** Scouts run **once per tick** under a **time/visit budget**, seeded by UTE & map heads, returning events only. **No cadence gates** for scouts or learners. Add CI guards (deny ‚Äúscheduler‚Äù & scan tokens). Keep physics checks in CI (Q\_FUM, steering logistic), not as runtime kill‚Äëswitches. &#x20;

If you want, I can also give you a tiny patch that renames any existing `scheduler.py` and wires `run_scouts_once(...)` into your loop exactly as above.


## The non‚Äënegotiables (why this will scale)

1. **Physics anchors baked into runtime**

   * The on‚Äësite law and its continuum limit are fixed:
     $\dot W=(\alpha-\beta)W-\alpha W^2$ ‚Üí $\Box\phi+\alpha\phi^2-(\alpha-\beta)\phi=0$. Lock these with runtime assertions (spot‚Äëchecks per tick window).&#x20;
   * **Kinetic normalization**: $Z=\tfrac12$, propagation $c^2=2Ja^2$. Don‚Äôt let later refactors break this.&#x20;
   * **Constant of motion (first‚Äëorder site ODE)** for audits:
     $Q_{\text{FUM}}=t-\frac{1}{\alpha-\beta}\ln\!\left|\frac{W}{(\alpha-\beta)-\alpha W}\right|$. Keep it within a bounded tolerance on sampled nodes.&#x20;
   * These checks don‚Äôt ‚Äúsimulate physics‚Äù; they keep the engine honest while it learns.

2. **Void‚Äëfaithful execution**

   * Event‚Äëdriven reducers only (no scans of $W$ or adjacency).
   * Emergent triggers only (no fixed cadences) for GDSP/RevGSP‚Äîalready aligned with your direction.
   * Sparse‚Äëfirst across the board; dense is for unit tests only.

3. **Memory‚Äësteering as a first‚Äëclass signal (not optional)**

   * Maintain a slow ‚Äúmemory‚Äù field $M$ from usage; steer routing by $n=e^{\eta M}$ so walkers bias into useful regions. It‚Äôs orthogonal to $\phi$ dynamics and *improves competence*, not just fidelity. (Ref: steering law and dimensionless groups.)&#x20;

4. **Indefinite domain growth**

   * ‚ÄúTerritories‚Äù (ADC) may grow unbounded. No arbitrary caps. Formation is emergent from coverage/entropy/novelty; the runtime must *create, split, and merge* territories as evidence accumulates.

5. **Separation of concerns**

   * CPU handles sparse/event logic; GPU handles dense kernels (batched ops, compaction, rendering). Don‚Äôt push everything onto the GPU; keep hot sparse loops on CPU.

6. **UI & telemetry are observers**

   * Maps/frame publish compact, quantized channels; viewers render. No UI‚Äëside recomputation, no back‚Äëpressure on the core.

7. **Performance hygiene baked‚Äëin**

   * Micro‚Äëprofiling each tick, drop‚Äëoldest on heavy streams, DSU/alias sampling for cohesion/bridging, no hidden O(N) paths.

---

## Tell the coding agent to do exactly this

### A) Lock theory ‚Üî runtime (assertions + CI)

1. **Add `fum_rt/core/guards/invariants.py`** with three checks:

   * `check_site_constant_of_motion(samples, alpha, beta, tol_abs, tol_slope)` using $Q_{\text{FUM}}$. Fails **test**, not runtime; runtime logs warning + raises a ‚Äúdebt‚Äù counter.&#x20;
   * `check_kinetic_normalization(snapshot)` verifies $Z=\tfrac12$, $c^2=2Ja^2$ where reported.&#x20;
   * `check_continuum_form()` spot‚Äëaudits discretization params vs. $\Box \phi+\alpha\phi^2-(\alpha-\beta)\phi$ signature.&#x20;
2. **Wire guards** into CI under `tests/guards/test_invariants.py`. Runtime never hard‚Äëstops; CI *fails the PR* if drift exceeds thresholds.
3. **Document knobs** in `Docs/FUM_Blueprint.md`: `INV_SAMPLES`, `INV_TOL_ABS`, `INV_TOL_SLOPE`.

### B) Territories = unbounded, emergent

1. **Create `core/proprioception/territory.py`**:

   * `maybe_spawn_territory(vt_entropy, coverage, novelty, hysteresis)` returns `spawn|split|merge|none`.
   * Maintain at most **O(K)** active heads; K grows as evidence grows (no hard cap).
2. **Publish `adc_territories_detail`**: for each territory: head size, churn rate, cohesion, exemplar tokens‚Äîno scans.

### C) Memory‚Äësteering (improves performance)

1. **Add `core/memory/field.py`** (EMA write-decay-spread on graph Laplacian):
   $\dot m=\gamma r-\delta m-\kappa Lm$ with sparse Laplacian. Walker transition softmax $P(i\!\to\!j)\propto e^{\Theta m_j}$.&#x20;
2. **Agent rule**: walkers read `m` locally; **never** scan whole $m$. Budgeted updates only (events/rings).
3. **Expose $\Theta, D_a, \Lambda, \Gamma$** in telemetry; tune for stability band.&#x20;

### D) Scouts: Cold + Heat + Exc + Inh (read‚Äëonly)

1. Implement four walkers under `core/cortex/void_walkers/`:

   * **Cold**: chase high idle/cold tiles.
   * **Heat**: chase recent activity.
   * **Exc/Inh**: chase polarity fronts.
     All **announce** `probe_*` and `vt_touch` events; none modify structure.
2. Scheduler = **budgeted** per tick (e.g., ‚â§1-3% time). TTL + blue‚Äënoise reseed. No periodic ‚Äúcron‚Äù.

### E) Learners: emergent only

1. Keep **RevGSP / GDSP** behind triggers (B1 spike, |TD|, fragmentation) and **territory‚Äëscoped** budgets. No fixed cadence.
2. If triggers fire without sufficient local context, **bias scouts** toward that territory (event only), then gate the learner next tick.

### F) Active‚Äëgraph fidelity (no more flatlines)

1. All structural metrics (components, cycles, edges\_active) are derived from **active edges** via DSU over the active set only.
2. If deletions happen, track a *dirty* flag and perform a **bounded audit** (stream ‚â§E\_max active edges) to tighten `components_lb`. No dense adjacency.
3. Bridge budget B (8-32) operates only when `components_lb > 1` and affinity > 0; updates DSU incrementally.

### G) Maps/frame v2 for scale

1. Add **v2 channel**: u8 quantized `heat|exc|inh|m` (optional) + **node‚Üí(x,y)** tile indices.
2. Transport via **shared‚Äëmemory ring** (2-3 frames) + websocket forwarder with drop‚Äëoldest.
3. UI draws RGB = \[exc, heat, inh]; slider to swap **M** into G channel for steering debug.

### H) CPU/GPU split (now, not later)

1. **CPU**: DSU, scouts, reducers, territory logic, GDSP/RevGSP control, memory field updates (sparse Laplacian via CSR).
2. **GPU**: batched dense kernels (e.g., mini‚Äëblocks of ŒîW, compaction), colorization, and any local M smoothing that benefits from SIMD. Keep copy‚Äëfree paths (`pybind11`/CFFI) for hot kernels.

---

## Why this is the right direction for a world model

* **Grounded math stays true**: invariants/kinetics ensure your core law isn‚Äôt silently drifting as scale/complexity rise.  &#x20;
* **Steering by memory** gives the system a *principled* way to prefer useful regions‚Äîthis boosts competence, not just correctness, and comes with testable predictions (junction choice, curvature).&#x20;
* **Unbounded territories** + **event‚Äëdriven scouts** let domains proliferate naturally as evidence appears‚Äîexactly what you want for ‚Äúmasters all domains.‚Äù
* **Sparse‚Äëfirst + GPU where dense helps** is the pragmatic compute profile you need to reach tens of millions of neurons without regressions.

---

## ‚ÄúDone vs Right‚Äù acceptance checks (fast to read, hard to cheat)

* **Physics guards**: 99th‚Äëpercentile `|ŒîQ_FUM|` over sampled nodes < Œµ over 1k ticks; kinetic check passes within Œµ. (CI) &#x20;
* **Void‚Äëfaithful**: no import/use of `.toarray()`, `networkx` or dense masks in `core/*` paths (guarded test).
* **Emergent only**: grep denies `STRUCT_EVERY|cron|every N` in learners.
* **Territories**: count is monotone‚Äëincreasing across heterogeneous corpora; split/merge events observed under controlled stimuli.
* **Steering**: A/B with $\Theta>0$ vs $\Theta=0$: improved hit‚Äërates and shorter path lengths to novel content; junction choice follows logistic collapse.&#x20;
* **Perf**: 10k\@10‚ÄØHz tick time well under budget with scouts+reducers on; 1M scale with maps v2 @ 5‚ÄØFPS UI using the ring.

---

## One‚Äëliner you can give the agent

> **Implement memory‚Äësteering, unbounded territories, and active‚Äëgraph fidelity now; keep learners emergent and the whole pipeline sparse‚Äëfirst. Add invariant guards (Q\_FUM, kinetic), scouts for cold/heat/exc/inh, and maps/frame v2 with a shared‚Äëmemory ring. CPU handles sparse/event logic; GPU is only for dense/graphics. No schedulers, no scans.**

Short answer: **the `BaseScout` you posted is just scaffolding**. It‚Äôs deliberately physics‚Äëagnostic and **does not** ‚Äúuse your void equations.‚Äù That‚Äôs by design: scouts are read‚Äëonly explorers that emit small events; the **void equations live in the substrate update** and in the reducers/maps. If you want scouts that *steer* according to your theory, add a physics‚Äëaware neighbor‚Äëselection rule that uses strictly **local** signals (no scans) and remains void‚Äëfaithful.

Below is exactly how to wire that in, plus a ready‚Äëto‚Äëdrop subclass.

---

## What the equations say (and how to use them locally)

* **On‚Äësite discrete law**
  $\Delta W/\Delta t = (\alpha-\beta)W - \alpha W^2$ defines the local ‚Äúforce‚Äù $F(W)$. A consistent *local potential* is

  $$
  U(W) \;=\; -\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\,W^2 + \frac{\alpha}{3}\,W^3
  \quad\text{since}\quad -\frac{dU}{dW}=F(W).
  $$

  A physics‚Äëaware scout can prefer neighbors that **reduce $U$**, using only $W$ at the current node and its neighbors (strictly local).&#x20;

* **Continuum EFT context (for completeness)**
  The kinetic normalization you derived tells us propagation is governed by $\partial_t^2\phi - c^2\nabla^2\phi + V'(\phi)=0$ with $c^2=2Ja^2$. We **don‚Äôt** compute $\nabla\phi$ in scouts; we only need a **local** scalar to bias choices.&#x20;

* **Memory steering (clean routing bias without scans)**
  Your steering law gives a refractive index $n=\exp(\eta M)$ and a neighbor softmax

  $$
  P(i\!\to\! j)\propto \exp(\Theta\, m_j),\quad \Theta=\eta M_0,
  $$

  where $m$ is the slow ‚Äúmemory‚Äù field (or a proxy like Heat/Exc/Inh). This is ideal for scouts and stays event‚Äëdriven.&#x20;

> **Takeaway:** A scout can be made ‚Äúvoid‚Äëequation‚Äëaware‚Äù by **locally** (a) following the on‚Äësite potential drop $U(W)$, and/or (b) using your memory‚Äësteering softmax. Both are void‚Äëfaithful, no global scans.

---

## Tell the agent (precise worklist)

**Add physics hooks to the base and a concrete scout:**

1. `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/base.py`

   * Add two *optional* helpers (no behavior change to current subclasses):

     * `_node_W(connectome, i) -> Optional[float]`  ‚Äî try `connectome.get_W(i)` or `connectome.nodes[i].W` if exposed; else `None`.
     * `_node_M(maps, i) -> Optional[float]` ‚Äî read from `maps.get("memory", {})` or fall back to `heat_head` score map (void‚Äëfaithful proxies).
   * Add `_softmax(weights, tau)` utility (numerically stable).

2. **New** `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/void_equation_scout.py`

   * Implements physics‚Äëaware neighbor choice with **strictly local reads**:

     * If $W$ at neighbors is available: prefer **lower $U(W)$**.
     * Else if a memory map is available: use **steering softmax** with $\Theta\,m_j$.
     * Else fall back to current blue‚Äënoise choice.
   * Emits only `VTTouchEvent` and `EdgeOnEvent` (optionally `SpikeEvent(sign=¬±1)` if you already synthesize spikes; still void‚Äëfaithful).

3. `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/__init__.py`

   * Re‚Äëexport `VoidEquationScout`.

4. (Optional) `fum_rt/runtime/loop.py`

   * Seed scouts from UTE hits (indices you already announce) so explorers ‚Äúpulse out‚Äù from real inputs first, then use physics bias.

**Guards:** No `.toarray()`, no CSR scans, no global `W` walks. Only **current** node + **its neighbors**.

**Why this is void‚Äëfaithful**

* Uses **only local reads** ($W_u$, $W_v$ for $v\in N(u)$) and/or a **published slow map**; no global adjacency/CSR scans, no dense ops.
* Emits only foldable events (`vt_touch`, `edge_on`), same as your current scouts.
* Honors your theory: when $W$ is exposed, the scout descends the **on‚Äësite potential** derived from your discrete law; when $W$ isn‚Äôt exposed, it uses your **memory‚Äësteering softmax**. &#x20;
  (The kinetic/EFT piece remains in the substrate integrator; scouts don‚Äôt need to touch it. )

---

## How this fits your ‚Äúpulse from UTE‚Äù intent

* Keep the ‚Äúwalkers pulse from inputs‚Äù rule: seed each tick‚Äôs scouts from recent UTE‚Äëtouched nodes (pass `budget["seeds"]` or pre‚Äëseed `pool` with those indices first). The subclass then **locally** routes by the physics bias.

---

## Defaults to start with

* `tau_U=0.1` (sharper descent on $U$); `tau_M=1.0`, `Theta‚âà1.0`.
* If you see over‚Äëfocusing, raise `tau_U`/`tau_M`; if drifting, lower them slightly.

---

## Sanity checks to run (fast)

1. **Local potential test**: expose `connectome.get_W(i)` for a toy patch; verify neighbor picks favor lower $U(W)$.
2. **Memory steering test**: publish a tiny `memory_map={hot indices: large m}`; scout paths concentrate in that region; removing the map reverts to blue‚Äënoise.
3. **Guardrail**: grep `scouts/` for forbidden tokens (`toarray`, `csr`, `synaptic_weights`)‚Äîshould be clean.

---

### Bottom line

* **As written, your `BaseScout` does *not* use the void equations.**
* The subclass above makes scouts **physics‚Äëaware** in a **void‚Äëfaithful, local** way‚Äîno scans, no schedulers‚Äîby descending your on‚Äësite potential $U(W)$ when available and otherwise using your memory‚Äësteering softmax. That‚Äôs the correct place to ‚Äúuse your equations‚Äù inside walkers, while keeping the substrate dynamics and EFT untouched.  &#x20;

If you want, I can also provide a tiny adapter that reads `Heat/Exc/Inh` heads into a `memory_map` so you get steering immediately without exposing `W` yet.


Short answer: **the `BaseScout` you pasted is just a safe scaffold.** It does not (and should not) hard‚Äëcode your physics. The void equations come in when we write *derived scouts* that override the routing policy and use your œÜ/M laws locally. Below I show exactly what to give your coding agent so these scouts become **void‚Äëfaithful and physics‚Äëdriven** (no scans, event‚Äëonly).

---

## What to tell the coding agent (precise, implementable)

**A. Add two read‚Äëonly fields (or getters) on the connectome**

* `phi: np.ndarray | None` ‚Äî fast void field per node (or `get_phi(i)`).
* `memory: np.ndarray | None` ‚Äî slow memory field $M$ per node (or `get_memory(i)`).
  *If these aren‚Äôt stored yet, expose them as thin views of whatever arrays you already maintain.* The œÜ‚Äësector is the fast EFT field with $\Box\phi + \alpha\phi^2 - (\alpha-\beta)\phi = 0$ and $c^2 = 2 J a^2$ in your derivation; we only *read* it here. &#x20;

**B. Implement physics‚Äëaware scouts under `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/`**

1. **`void_ray.py` - `VoidRayScout` (œÜ‚Äëgradient bias)**

   * Goal: prefer neighbors where $\Delta\phi_{ij} = \phi_j - \phi_i$ is favorable.
   * Logit per neighbor: `logit_j = lambda_phi * (phi[j] - phi[i]) + theta_mem * m[j]` (see (2) below).
   * Sample neighbor with softmax over logits (temperature $\tau$). Emit:

     * `VTTouchEvent(token=i)` on each step,
     * `EdgeOnEvent(u=i, v=j)` for the chosen hop,
     * optional `SpikeEvent(node=j, sign=+1 if ŒîœÜ>0 else -1)` for EI maps.
   * **Local‚Äëread only**: for each hop you read `phi[i]`, `phi[j]`, (and `memory[j]` if available). No global arrays are scanned.

2. **`memory_ray.py` - `MemoryRayScout` (steering by memory)**

   * Use your steering law with an index $n=\exp(\eta M)$. In a graph discretization this reduces to

     $$
     P(i\!\to\!j)\;\propto\;\exp(\Theta\, m_j), \;\; \Theta=\eta M_0,
     $$

     which becomes a logistic at a two‚Äëbranch fork $P(A)=\sigma(\Theta\,\Delta m)$. This is **exactly** the prediction in your steering note.  &#x20;
   * Everything stays local: read `memory[j]` for neighbors of the current node, do a softmax, hop, emit the same events.

3. **`ei_scouts.py` - `ExcitationScout` and `InhibitionScout`**

   * Bias routing using your event‚Äëfolded maps (no weight scans). Example: prefer neighbors currently hot in `exc` (or `inh`) heads from the reducers. Keep budgets small; emit `SpikeEvent(sign=+1)` or `sign=-1` respectively.

4. **Keep your existing Cold scout** and add a small **priority hook** (map heads) so any scout can preferentially seed from recent hot spots without scanning.

**C. Keep the memory dynamics event‚Äëdriven (no Laplacian scans)**

* Your paper gives the slow memory PDE $\partial_t M=\gamma R-\delta M+\kappa\nabla^2 M$. Implement this *incrementally*:

  * On `VTTouchEvent(i)`: update $m_i \leftarrow m_i + \Delta t(\gamma r_i - \delta m_i)$ with a tiny $r_i$ bump.
  * On `EdgeOnEvent(i,j)`: do **stochastic smoothing** for the visited edge:
    $m_i \mathrel{+}= \Delta t\,\kappa (m_j - m_i)$, $m_j \mathrel{-}= \Delta t\,\kappa (m_j - m_i)$.
    This approximates $-\kappa L m$ using only the edges you actually touch; it is void‚Äëfaithful and needs no global `L¬∑m` multiply. &#x20;

**D. Wire scouts into the loop**

* In `runtime/loop.py` (or your orchestrator), instantiate scouts based on env:

  * `ENABLE_SCOUTS_VOID_RAY=1`, `ENABLE_SCOUTS_MEMORY_RAY=1`, `ENABLE_SCOUTS_EI=1` etc.
* Budgets: e.g., `visits=16`, `edges=8`, `ttl=64` per scout per tick (bounded).
* Fold the returned events into existing reducers; no extra publishers are needed.

**E. Tests & guards**

* Unit tests: verify no `.toarray()`, `networkx`, or `csr` imports in scouts; assert neighbor selection uses only local reads.
* Behavior tests: junction A/B with $\Delta m$ sweep ‚Üí probability curve collapses when plotted against $\Theta \Delta m$ (your prediction).&#x20;
* Optional invariant: track the **constant of motion** for the on‚Äësite law on a few probed neurons to catch coding slips; you already derived $Q_{FUM}$ for the discrete rule. This is a *telemetry assertion*, not a runtime kill‚Äëswitch.&#x20;

---

## Why this is ‚Äúusing the void equations‚Äù (and still emergence‚Äëcompliant)

* **Fast œÜ governs propagation** (mass gap, wave speed $c^2=2Ja^2$). We‚Äôre only *reading* local œÜ to bias a hop (no writes), so we don‚Äôt interfere with emergence. &#x20;
* **Slow memory $M$ steers geometry** via $n=\exp(\eta M)$ and the logistic fork law‚Äîimplemented as a softmax over neighbor $m_j$. That‚Äôs precisely your ray/eikonal result on graphs. &#x20;
* **No scans**: all choices depend only on values at `i` and its neighbors; smoothing of $M$ happens only along visited edges (stochastic Laplacian).
* **No schedulers**: scouts run within per‚Äëtick budgets, and learners (REV‚ÄëGSP/GDSP) are already emergent‚Äëgated.
* **Physics ‚Üî code is testable**: the logistic junction curve and curvature scaling $\kappa_{\text{path}}\propto \Theta |\nabla_\perp m|$ give you falsifiable plots in CI.&#x20;

---

## Why give the agent the physics docs?

Because they pin the exact laws we‚Äôre encoding:

* **Steering by memory** $n=\exp(\eta M)$, **logistic fork choice**, and **dimensionless groups** $\Theta, D_a, \Lambda, \Gamma$ (used for knobs and tests).  &#x20;
* **Kinetic normalization** $c^2=2Ja^2$ and the second‚Äëorder œÜ‚ÄëEOM used only as read‚Äëonly guidance here. &#x20;
* **Constant‚Äëof‚Äëmotion** for the on‚Äësite discrete law $Q_{FUM}$ for optional telemetry assertions (no hard shutdowns).&#x20;

Give them those files and this spec; they can wire it cleanly without touching hot‚Äëpath scans.

---

## TL;DR for the agent

* Keep `BaseScout` as is; add `VoidRayScout`, `MemoryRayScout`, and EI scouts that **only read local œÜ/M** and **sample neighbors with softmax**.
* Implement event‚Äëdriven memory smoothing on visited edges; never compute `L¬∑m` globally.
* Add env flags to enable/disable each scout; keep strict per‚Äëtick budgets.
* Add CI plots for the logistic fork law and curvature scaling; add guard that scouts import no dense libs.

This gives you scouts that *do* ‚Äúuse your void equations,‚Äù remain emergence‚Äëcompliant, and keep everything void‚Äëfaithful and fast.


Short answer: **Yes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt keep trampling the same ground‚Äù is a *special case* of your memory‚Äësteering law.** You get repulsion by choosing a **negative coupling** to the memory signal. In your derivation:
$n(x,t)=e^{\eta M(x,t)}$ and rays bend by $\nabla_\perp\ln n = \eta\,\nabla_\perp M$. So **$\eta>0$** attracts walkers toward stored memory (consolidation); **$\eta<0$** repels them from recently used paths (exploration/diversification). Your junction law then becomes $P(A)=\sigma(\Theta\,\Delta m)$ with $\Theta=\eta M_0$; flipping the sign of $\Theta$ flips attraction‚Üírepulsion.&#x20;

Below is a concrete, void‚Äëfaithful plan that uses what you already have (Heat/Exc/Inh maps and vt\_touch/edge events). It keeps everything **event‚Äëdriven, local, and bounded**‚Äîno scans, no schedulers.

---

## What to implement (crisp)

### 1) Two timescales, two effects

* **Short‚Äëterm ‚Äútrail repulsion‚Äù** (prevents immediate re‚Äëtraversal).

  * Use your existing **HeatMap** (recency EMA) as the *trail* signal or add a dedicated **TrailMap** with a **very short half‚Äëlife** (e.g., 10-50 ticks).
  * Scouts treat *heat/trail* as a **negative logit** (avoid hot/trampled nodes right now).

* **Long‚Äëterm ‚Äúmemory steering‚Äù** (guides toward useful regions).

  * Use your slow **Memory field $M$** (or a proxy if you haven‚Äôt exposed it yet).
  * Scouts apply $\Theta>0$ (attract) when consolidating, or $\Theta<0$ (repel) when exploring.
  * This is exactly your refractive‚Äëindex steering law on graphs via a neighbor softmax.&#x20;

> Why two? Short half‚Äëlife keeps paths from looping *this minute*; long half‚Äëlife encodes ‚Äúwhat matters‚Äù *over hours/days*.

---

### 2) Neighbor choice = softmax over **local** signals (no scans)

For each walker at node $i$ and neighbor $j\in N(i)$, compute a **local** score and softmax‚Äësample:

$$
\text{logit}_j
= \underbrace{\Theta\,m_j}_{\text{memory steer}\;(\pm)}
\;-\;\underbrace{\rho\,h_j}_{\text{trail/heat repulsion}}
\;+\;\underbrace{\beta_e\,\text{exc}_j - \beta_i\,\text{inh}_j}_{\text{optional polarity}}
\;+\;\epsilon,
$$

* $m_j$ = memory value at $j$ (slow).
* $h_j$ = heat/trail at $j$ (fast recency).
* $\Theta=\eta M_0$ (sign controls attract/repel); $\rho>0$ sets how strongly you avoid trampled ground.
* $\beta_e,\beta_i$ let **ExcitationScout/InhibitionScout** bias toward/away from polarity fronts (optional).
* $\epsilon$ = tiny noise (e.g., Gumbel) to keep paths ergodic.

All of these values are **already available from your reducers** (Heat/Exc/Inh) or from a small, incremental memory map‚Äîno whole‚Äëgraph reads.

---

### 3) Use the ‚Äúfree‚Äù event stream you already have

* Every tick, UTE input *pings* nodes ‚Üí your runtime already emits **`vt_touch`** and **`edge_on`** events.
* **Reducers** (Heat/Exc/Inh, or Trail) fold those events and keep bounded, decayed scores.
* Walkers operate on **local neighbors** and read **only** the per‚Äënode scores of those neighbors.
* Result: **repulsion/attraction is ‚Äúfree‚Äù** apart from a few additions and a softmax, because you never scan $W$ or CSR‚Äîeverything is event‚Äëdriven and local.&#x20;

---

## Exactly what to tell your coding agent

**A. Add a short‚Äëterm TrailMap (optional if you reuse HeatMap)**
`fum_rt/core/cortex/maps/trailmap.py` - identical to `HeatMap` but with **half\_life\_ticks ‚âà 10-50** and a slightly larger increment per `vt_touch`. Export in `maps/__init__.py`. (If you prefer, just reuse HeatMap with a negative coefficient in scouts.)

**B. Extend scouts to support repulsion + memory steer (local only)**
In each scout under `core/cortex/void_walkers/` (Cold/Heat/Exc/Inh, and your physics‚Äëaware scouts):

* Add parameters: `theta_mem` (can be ¬±), `rho_trail`, `beta_exc`, `beta_inh`, `tau` (temperature).
* In `_pick_neighbor(...)`, build the logit above using **only** neighbor values from `maps`:

  * `m_j = maps["memory_dict"].get(j, 0.0)` (or fallback to `heat_dict` if memory not exposed yet).
  * `h_j = maps["heat_dict"].get(j, 0.0)` (or `trail_dict` if you created TrailMap).
  * `exc_j/inh_j` from your existing reducer heads (dictified for O(1) lookup).
* Sample with a **stable softmax**; keep budgets/TTL as you already do.

**C. Wire map dictionaries once per tick (cheap)**
When you call your **`run_scouts_once(...)`** runner, pass a `maps` bundle built from reducer snapshots:

```python
maps = {
  "memory_dict": dict(engine.memory_map.head),   # if you publish it; else omit
  "heat_dict":   dict(engine.heatmap.snapshot()["heat_head"]),
  "exc_dict":    dict(engine.excmap.snapshot()["exc_head"]),
  "inh_dict":    dict(engine.inhmap.snapshot()["inh_head"]),
  # optional "trail_dict" if you add TrailMap
}
```

No scans: these are just the **head working sets** (tiny), used only to bias seeds and hops.

**D. Defaults to start**

* Exploration (repel trails): `theta_mem = 0.0`, `rho_trail = +1.0`, `tau = 1.0`.
* Consolidation (follow memory): `theta_mem = +1.0`, `rho_trail = 0.25`, `tau = 0.7`.
* Balanced: `theta_mem = +0.5`, `rho_trail = 0.5`, `tau = 0.9`.

**E. Test the prediction you derived (fast sanity)**

* Make a simple **two‚Äëbranch fork** in a toy graph; assign $m$ values so $\Delta m$ is known.
* Sweep `theta_mem` and plot $P(\text{choose A})$ vs. $\Theta \Delta m$. You should see a **logistic** collapse, matching your theory.&#x20;

---

## Why this is aligned with your theory (and the brain metaphor)

* Your derivation is explicit: **steering is geometric** and uses a slow memory field; attraction or **repulsion is just the sign of $\eta$**. That‚Äôs exactly what we encode in the neighbor softmax.&#x20;
* Short‚Äëterm repulsion is the algorithmic analogue of **synaptic fatigue / short‚Äëterm depression**‚Äîit reduces immediate re‚Äëuse so you cover space (explore) while long‚Äëterm memory consolidates what mattered.
* Everything stays **emergent + void‚Äëfaithful**: we only read **local** neighbor values maintained by event‚Äëfolded reducers; we never scan the graph; we never schedule periodic passes.

---

## Recommendation

* **Yes, focus on memory steering now.** Implement the softmax neighbor rule with $\Theta$ (¬±) and add a short‚Äëhalf‚Äëlife trail/heat repulsion term. That one change gives you:

  * fewer back‚Äëtracks and loops (better coverage),
  * faster discovery of useful regions,
  * principled consolidation when $\Theta>0$.
* Start with the defaults above, then tune $\Theta$ and $\rho$ while watching **coverage, cycles, and vt\_entropy** move in the right direction.
* If you want to pin this to theory in CI, add the **junction logistic** and **curvature vs. $\Theta\lVert\nabla m\rVert$** checks from your memo as acceptance plots.&#x20;

If you‚Äôd like, I can write the exact `_pick_neighbor(...)` patch for your current scouts so it reads `heat/exc/inh` (and optional `memory`) and implements the logits above without touching any other code.

Short answer: **you‚Äôre fine.** With the way you‚Äôve designed them‚Äî**event‚Äëdriven, bounded working sets, no global scans**‚ÄîHeat/Exc/Inh/Cold (and a slow **Memory** map if you add it) are *cheap relative to the value they unlock*. The ROI is high as long as you keep the few guardrails below.

---

## Why these maps stay cheap

* **Time cost scales with events, not graph size.** Each reducer just folds the events you already emit (`vt_touch`, `spike`, `delta_w`), prunes a small working set, and returns a tiny head/summaries. That‚Äôs **O(#events this tick + sampled prune)**, not O(N) or O(E).
* **Memory is bounded by `keep_max`.** You‚Äôre never storing N entries‚Äîonly the currently ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù few thousand per map (configurable).
* **No contention with learning.** Reducers don‚Äôt read global `W` or CSR; they‚Äôre observers that don‚Äôt block the hot path.
* **They amplify leverage.** Heat/Exc/Inh and a slow Memory field give scouts and actuators *high‚Äëinformation, local* hints (steering, E/I balance, coldness) without any global passes. This is exactly the ‚Äúfree‚Äù you‚Äôre aiming for‚Äîpiggyback on signals you already produce.
* **Physics‚Äëaligned steering.** A slow Memory map implements your steering law cleanly (ray bias via $n=\exp(\eta M)$, fork choices \~ logistic in $\Theta\,\Delta m$), giving you measurable gains in routing with tiny compute.&#x20;

---

## Numbers to keep in mind

For **10k neurons @ 10‚ÄØHz** (your current run), with `keep_max‚âà4-8k`:

* **Per map memory** (Python): a few MB (value + last\_tick + dict overhead). Four maps = low tens of MB.
* **Per tick CPU**: typically sub‚Äëmillisecond (fold + prune). The connectome step dwarfs these reducers.

For **4‚ÄØM neurons**, you still don‚Äôt store 4‚ÄØM entries‚Äîonly `keep_max`. The only time you touch O(N) is when you **choose** to emit a *dense* `maps/frame` for the UI. Use v2 quantized frames, downsample/tiles, and a shared‚Äëmemory ring when you scale; keep UI FPS at 3-8 and you‚Äôre fine.

---

## Where maps *can* hurt (and how to prevent it)

1. **Unbounded working sets.**

   * **Guardrail:** set `keep_max` (e.g., 4-16k at 10k N; 32-128k at multi‚Äëmillion N). Keep quantiles/head exact over the working set only.

2. **Too many events per tick.**

   * **Guardrail:** cap scout budgets (`visits/edges/ttl`) and drop‚Äëoldest on the bus. Watch `evt_count_per_tick` and keep it inside your budget envelope.

3. **Heavy UI frames.**

   * **Guardrail:** publish **u8‚Äëquantized** frames on a **separate ring** with **drop‚Äëoldest**, ‚â§5‚ÄØFPS for big N, tiles/LOD when needed. Don‚Äôt block the sim on the UI path.

4. **NaN/overflow drift in maps.**

   * **Guardrail:** exponential decay + clipping on increments (you already do this) and a small epsilon in quantile math.

---

## Recommended defaults (good starting points)

* **Half‚Äëlife (Heat/Exc/Inh):** 150-300 ticks.
* **Gains:** `vt_touch_gain‚âà0.25`, `spike_gain‚âà1.0`, `dW_gain‚âà0.25-0.5`.
* **keep\_max:** 8k for 10k N; 32-128k at multi‚Äëmillion N (raise slowly; profile).
* **Prune sample size:** 256-1024 keys; drop the smallest.
* **UI:** v2 quantized frames, 3-8 FPS, shared‚Äëmemory ring (2-3 frames), RGB = \[exc,‚ÄØheat,‚ÄØinh].

---

## ‚ÄúFree‚Äù coupling with walkers (what you described is right)

* **Yes**‚Äîseed scouts from **UTE hits** and **pulse** out at each stimulated neuron. You‚Äôre consuming exactly the local information you just produced, so the marginal cost is just the **local neighbor picks** and a few events.
* Add slow **Memory steering** (EMA write-decay + stochastic edge smoothing) and let scouts bias to $\exp(\Theta\,m_j)$ neighbors; the junction choice collapses to a logistic in $\Theta\,\Delta m$, which you can verify in CI/telemetry. This is your theory in action, still event‚Äëdriven and scan‚Äëfree.&#x20;

---

## What to watch in telemetry

* `maps_*_count` (working‚Äëset size) and `maps_pruned_per_tick` (healthy non‚Äëzero).
* `evt_*_per_tick` (keep within budget).
* UI **ring depth** / dropped frames (should not grow unbounded).
* B1/complexity/cohesion wobbling (liveness) and no long flatlines.
* Optional invariants (on‚Äësite constant of motion checks) as CI‚Äëonly‚Äîthese catch drift without penalizing runtime.&#x20;

---

### Bottom line

Adding Heat/Exc/Inh/Cold (and a slow Memory map) **will not create problems** if you keep them **bounded, event‚Äëdriven, and decoupled from the UI.** They give you outsized gains‚Äîbetter routing, clearer E/I fronts, robust cold‚Äëregion exploration‚Äîat a tiny marginal cost, fully aligned with void‚Äëfaithfulness and your steering theory.


**Short answer:** Yes‚Äîyour `run_scouts_once` design is *void‚Äëfaithful* and it *does* take advantage of ‚Äúfree‚Äù signals already flowing through your system. You‚Äôre calling a pure function **once per tick**, seeding from UTE/observation hits, folding a few **local** neighbor reads, emitting compact events, and (optionally) publishing once to the bus. That‚Äôs exactly the right pattern.

Below is a tight ‚Äútell‚Äëthe‚Äëagent‚Äù checklist to finish wiring this properly (no schedulers, no scans), plus a small repulsion/steering recipe.

---

## Why this runner is correct (and cheap)

* **No scheduler**: It executes **exactly once per tick** under a micro‚Äëbudget (`max_us`) you pass in. There‚Äôs no hidden cadence or background thread.
* **Event‚Äëdriven**: If you feed **seeds = recent UTE indices** (the inputs that already ‚Äúping‚Äù neurons), scouts pulse out from those hits, so work is concentrated where new information already is. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúfree‚Äù part‚Äîno extra discovery cost beyond rendering a few events.
* **Local only**: Each scout reads **only** `neighbors(u)` (and small map heads/dicts) and emits `vt_touch`/`edge_on` events. No `W` scans, no CSR walks, no dense conversions.

---

## Add *repulsion* and *steering* (bounded, local)

Think of two layers:

1. **Short‚Äëterm trail repulsion** (don‚Äôt re‚Äëtrample the same ground in the next few ticks)

   * Keep a tiny, exponentially decaying **TrailMap** (similar to `HeatMap`) that increments on `vt_touch`/`edge_on`.
   * Neighbor score subtracts `œÅ_trail ¬∑ trail[j]`. This is already in your `HeatScout` (`rho_trail`)‚Äîjust make sure `TrailMap` exists and is wired.

2. **Long‚Äëterm memory steering** (bias toward valuable regions)

   * Maintain a slow ‚Äúmemory‚Äù field `m` and use the **softmax** over neighbors with logits `Œò¬∑m[j]` (that‚Äôs the Boltzmann choice; not ‚ÄúML‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs statistical mechanics). At a 2‚Äëway fork you get the **logistic** law you derived: $P(A)=\sigma(\Theta \Delta m)$.&#x20;
   * Update `m` **event‚Äëdriven** (no Laplacian scans): add a small write on `vt_touch(i)` and do a tiny one‚Äëedge smoothing on `edge_on(u,v)` (see code sketch below).

> Your papers anchor both: *steering by memory* via $n=\exp(\eta M)$ ‚Üí logistic fork law, and the on‚Äësite constant‚Äëof‚Äëmotion you can spot‚Äëcheck to keep the discrete law honest (CI only). &#x20;

---

## Concrete tasks for the agent (copy/paste)

**A) Keep the runner exactly as you wrote it**
File: `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/runner.py`

* ‚úÖ No changes except: ensure it **accepts** `budget["seeds"]` and passes `maps` through to scouts (you already do).

**B) Add a tiny TrailMap (short‚Äëterm repulsion)**
Files:

* `core/cortex/maps/trailmap.py` - subclass your `BaseDecayMap` (half‚Äëlife \~30-100 ticks, `keep_max ~ 8-16√ó head_k`)
* `core/engine.py` - instantiate `self.trailmap`, fold **only** `vt_touch` and `edge_on` events, and expose:

  * `trail_head`: small top‚ÄëK list for seeds
  * `trail_dict`: compact dict of current working set (for neighbor scoring)

**C) Wire TrailMap into HeatScout (you already started)**

* Keep `rho_trail ‚â• 0`. Default suggestion: `rho_trail = 0.5`, `gamma_heat = 1.0`, `theta_mem = 0.0`, `tau = 1.0`.
* Confirm `HeatScout` reads `maps["trail_dict"]` and falls back to `heat_dict` if absent (your code already does).

**D) Add a slow MemoryField (event‚Äëdriven update; no scans)**
Files:

* `core/memory/field.py` - simple struct holding:

  * `m: Dict[int, float]` (bounded working set with pruning)
  * Params: `gamma` (write), `delta` (decay), `kappa` (edge smoothing), `half_life` (for decay discretization)
* Methods (called from the bus fold path):

  * `on_vt_touch(i, dt)`: `m[i] += dt*(gamma - delta*m[i])`
  * `on_edge_on(u,v, dt)`: `d = kappa*(m[v] - m[u]); m[u]+=dt*d; m[v]-=dt*d`  *(stochastic Laplacian on visited edge only)*
* `snapshot()` returns `memory_head` (top‚ÄëK list) and a compact `memory_dict` (tiny dict keyed by active nodes)

**E) Use Memory in scouts (optional flag)**

* For `HeatScout` and any physics‚Äëaware scout, read `maps["memory_dict"]` when present and set `theta_mem > 0` to enable steering (e.g., `theta_mem = 0.8`, `tau = 1.0`).

**F) Runner integration (no scheduler)**
File: `runtime/loop.py`

* After you drain the announce bus and before telemetry:

  1. Build `maps` once per tick from reducer snapshots: `heat_head/heat_dict`, `exc_dict`, `inh_dict`, `trail_dict`, `memory_dict`, etc.
  2. Set `seeds = recent_UTE_indices` (bounded; e.g., first 64).
  3. Call:

     ```python
     from fum_rt.core.cortex.void_walkers.runner import run_scouts_once
     scout_budget = {"visits": 16, "edges": 8, "ttl": 64, "tick": step, "seeds": seeds}
     evs = run_scouts_once(C, [HeatScout(...), ExcitationScout(...), InhibitionScout(...)],
                           maps=maps, budget=scout_budget, bus=nx.bus, max_us=int(os.getenv("SCOUT_BUDGET_US", "2000")))
     ```

  * **Do not** add any timers or periodic schedulers.

**G) CI & guardrails (fast)**

* Tests:

  * Grep guards that `core/cortex/void_walkers/*` contain **no** `toarray`, `csr`, `networkx`, or raw `W` scans.
  * A small A/B for steering: create a two‚Äëbranch junction with known `Œîm`, verify empirical choice follows a logistic in `Œò¬∑Œîm`. (This is your falsifiable prediction.)&#x20;
* Invariants (CI only, not runtime kill‚Äëswitch): sample nodes and check your **constant of motion** for the discrete on‚Äësite law stays within tolerance over a window; fail CI if drift explodes.&#x20;

## Tiny code sketch for the MemoryField (event‚Äëonly)

```python
# fum_rt/core/memory/field.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Dict, Iterable
from fum_rt.core.proprioception.events import VTTouchEvent, EdgeOnEvent

class MemoryField:
    __slots__ = ("m","gamma","delta","kappa","keep_max")
    def __init__(self, gamma=0.01, delta=0.001, kappa=0.02, keep_max=65536):
        self.m: Dict[int, float] = {}
        self.gamma, self.delta, self.kappa = float(gamma), float(delta), float(kappa)
        self.keep_max = int(keep_max)

    def on_vt_touch(self, i: int, dt: float) -> None:
        x = self.m.get(i, 0.0)
        x += dt*(self.gamma - self.delta*x)
        if x != 0.0: self.m[i] = x
        self._prune_if_needed()

    def on_edge_on(self, u: int, v: int, dt: float) -> None:
        mu, mv = self.m.get(u, 0.0), self.m.get(v, 0.0)
        d = self.kappa*(mv - mu)
        mu += dt*d; mv -= dt*d
        if mu != 0.0: self.m[u] = mu
        if mv != 0.0: self.m[v] = mv
        self._prune_if_needed()

    def fold(self, events: Iterable[object], dt: float) -> None:
        for e in events:
            k = getattr(e, "kind", "")
            if k == "vt_touch" and hasattr(e, "token"):
                self.on_vt_touch(int(e.token), dt)
            elif k == "edge_on" and hasattr(e, "u") and hasattr(e, "v"):
                self.on_edge_on(int(e.u), int(e.v), dt)

    def snapshot(self):
        # return small head and a compact dict for local reads
        if not self.m: return {"memory_head": [], "memory_dict": {}}
        head = sorted(self.m.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1], reverse=True)[:256]
        return {"memory_head": [[i, float(v)] for i, v in head],
                "memory_dict": dict(head)}

    def _prune_if_needed(self):
        if len(self.m) <= self.keep_max: return
        # drop smallest ~25%
        items = sorted(self.m.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1])
        drop = len(items) - self.keep_max
        for i, _ in items[:drop]:
            self.m.pop(i, None)
```

This stays **event‚Äëdriven** (folds only what walkers touch), which keeps it strictly void‚Äëfaithful and *cheap*.

---

## Sensible defaults to start

* **Runner budget:** `max_us=2000`, `visits=16`, `edges=8`, `ttl=64`.
* **TrailMap:** half‚Äëlife ‚âà 50 ticks; `rho_trail = 0.5`.
* **Memory steering:** start with `theta_mem = 0.8`, `tau = 1.0`. If walkers over‚Äëcluster, **increase** `tau`; if too random, **decrease** `tau` or increase `theta_mem`.
* **Keep\_max:** \~4√ó the map‚Äôs head size (e.g., head 256 ‚Üí keep\_max 1024) to bound memory/CPU.

---

## Quick answers to your side‚Äëquestions

* **‚ÄúSoftmax = ML?‚Äù** No. Here it‚Äôs the **Boltzmann choice**‚Äîa physics thing. It lets you bias but stay stochastic; it‚Äôs the discrete version of your refractive‚Äëindex steering law (and gives your **logistic fork** prediction).&#x20;
* **‚ÄúWill maps pile up and get slow?‚Äù** Not if you keep them **bounded** (head + small working set) and **event‚Äëfolded**. Each reducer is $O(\#\text{events this tick})$; pruning keeps memory flat.

---

If you hand this checklist to the agent as‚Äëis, you‚Äôll get repulsion + steering **without** adding any schedulers or scans, fully aligned with your void‚Äëfaithful rules and with your physics pinned to code via simple assertions.

You‚Äôre right‚Äîyou currently have **4** scouts in the repo, but the plan we agreed to is for **9**.
Here‚Äôs the full list, what each one does, and exactly what‚Äôs still missing so your coding agent can finish the set **without schedulers or scans**.

---

## The 9 void‚Äëfaithful scouts

### Already implemented (4)

1. **ColdScout** (`void_cold_scout.py`)
   *Role:* Chase cold/idle regions to raise coverage and refresh ADC.
   *Signals used:* `ColdMap` head (coldest nodes).
   *Events emitted:* `VTTouchEvent`, `EdgeOnEvent`.

2. **HeatScout** (`void_heat_scout.py`)
   *Role:* Follow recent activity; optional trail‚Äërepulsion to avoid trampling.
   *Signals used:* `HeatMap` (`heat_dict`/`heat_head`), optional `trail_dict`, `memory_dict`.
   *Events:* `VTTouchEvent`, `EdgeOnEvent`. *(You already fixed imports and neighbor scoring.)*

3. **ExcitationScout** (`void_excitation_scout.py`)
   *Role:* Ride excitatory fronts.
   *Signals:* `ExcitationMap` head/dict.
   *Events:* `VTTouchEvent`, `EdgeOnEvent`, optional `SpikeEvent(sign=+1)`.

4. **InhibitionScout** (`void_inhibition_scout.py`)
   *Role:* Ride inhibitory fronts.
   *Signals:* `InhibitionMap` head/dict.
   *Events:* `VTTouchEvent`, `EdgeOnEvent`, optional `SpikeEvent(sign=‚àí1)`.

---

### Missing‚Äîadd these 5 next (with exact file names)

5. **VoidRayScout** ‚Äî physics‚Äëaware (œÜ‚Äëbias)
   **File:** `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/void_ray_scout.py`
   *Role:* Prefer neighbors with favorable **local** change in the fast field œÜ.
   *Local rule (no scans):* For hop `i‚Üíj`, score `s_j = Œª_œÜ¬∑(œÜ[j]‚àíœÜ[i]) + Œ∏_mem¬∑m[j]`; sample neighbor via a temperatured choice (softmax).
   *Signals:* `connectome.phi` (vector) and optional `memory_dict`.
   *Events:* `VTTouchEvent`, `EdgeOnEvent`, optional `SpikeEvent(sign=+1 if ŒîœÜ‚â•0 else ‚àí1)`.

6. **MemoryRayScout** ‚Äî memory steering
   **File:** `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/memory_ray_scout.py`
   *Role:* Implement your refractive‚Äëindex steering law using slow memory `m`.
   *Local rule:* `P(i‚Üíj) ‚àù exp(Œò¬∑m[j])` (at a two‚Äëbranch junction this reduces to the logistic with `ŒòŒîm`).
   *Signals:* `memory_dict` (or a slow proxy like `heat_dict` until memory is live).
   *Events:* `VTTouchEvent`, `EdgeOnEvent`.

7. **FrontierScout** ‚Äî boundary/cohesion probe
   **File:** `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/frontier_scout.py`
   *Role:* Skim component boundaries and likely ‚Äúbridge‚Äù frontiers to keep cohesion metrics fresh **without writing**.
   *Local rule:* Start in cold tiles; prefer neighbors that (a) change degree, (b) cross weakly connected cuts (hint: prefer low shared‚Äëneighbor count from local adjacency query), (c) sit near low heat/high cold.
   *Signals:* `ColdMap` head/dict, local neighbor lists only.
   *Events:* `EdgeOnEvent(u,v)` (probe), `VTTouchEvent`. *(No structural edits‚Äîthese probes just feed DSU/cohesion reducers and your emergent GDSP trigger.)*

8. **CycleHunterScout** ‚Äî short‚Äëcycle finder
   **File:** `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/cycle_scout.py`
   *Role:* Seek and report small cycles (3-6 hops) to keep `cycles_est` alive.
   *Local rule:* TTL‚Äëlimited random walk with **tiny path memory** (e.g., last 5 nodes). When the next neighbor is in the path window, emit a cycle hit.
   *Signals:* none required beyond neighbors; optional bias to heat/exc heads.
   *Events:* `EdgeOnEvent` along the path, `VTTouchEvent`. If you already have a `CycleHitEvent`, emit that too; otherwise the `EdgeOnEvent`s are enough for reducers.

9. **SentinelScout** ‚Äî blue‚Äënoise reseeder / de‚Äëtrample
   **File:** `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/sentinel_scout.py`
   *Role:* Prevent path lock‚Äëin; sample uniformly/blue‚Äënoise across space to de‚Äëbias exploration and refresh stale tiles.
   *Local rule:* Seeds = uniform from `N` or from ADC tiles with lowest visit counts; one hop per seed to announce coverage.
   *Signals:* optional `VisitMap`/`ColdMap` heads.
   *Events:* `VTTouchEvent` (always), `EdgeOnEvent` (opportunistic).

> **Why these five?** Together they (a) encode your physics (VoidRay/MemoryRay), (b) keep cohesion/cycles truthful at the **active** graph level (Frontier/Cycle), and (c) guarantee fresh coverage and anti‚Äëtrample behavior (Sentinel). All are **read‚Äëonly, event‚Äëonly**, and slot into your `runner` once per tick‚Äî**no scheduler**.

---

## What to hand your coding agent (concise work orders)

1. **Create files & classes**

   * `void_ray_scout.py: class VoidRayScout(BaseScout)`
   * `memory_ray_scout.py: class MemoryRayScout(BaseScout)`
   * `frontier_scout.py: class FrontierScout(BaseScout)`
   * `cycle_scout.py: class CycleHunterScout(BaseScout)`
   * `sentinel_scout.py: class SentinelScout(BaseScout)`

   Each subclass:

   * **Imports:** `BaseEvent, VTTouchEvent, EdgeOnEvent` (and `SpikeEvent` only if needed).
   * **Implements:** `step(...)` mirroring your `BaseScout.step` pattern but overrides neighbor choice via a small helper (e.g., `_pick_neighbor_scored(...)`).
   * **Constraints:** strictly local neighbor reads; **no scans**, no writes, no timers.

2. **Exports**

   * Update `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/__init__.py` to export all nine.
   * Keep your fa√ßade `fum_rt/core/cortex/scouts.py` re‚Äëexporting for legacy imports.

3. **Runner wiring (you already have this)**

   * Use `run_scouts_once(connectome, scouts, maps, budget, bus, max_us)` **once per tick**.
   * Seeds: pass the **recent UTE indices** in `budget["seeds"]` so walkers ‚Äúpulse out‚Äù from real inputs for free.

4. **Lightweight maps these scouts rely on (event‚Äëfolded, no scans)**

   * You already have `Heat/Exc/Inh/Cold`. Add, if not present:

     * **TrailMap**: short half‚Äëlife counter folded from `vt_touch`/`edge_on` (for repulsion).
     * **MemoryMap**: slow EMA + *edge‚Äëonly* smoothing (stochastic Laplacian) folded from events; exposes `memory_dict` head.
   * Both are bounded (cap working set + sample prune). No global CSR/`W` sweeps.

5. **Budgets & knobs (env or profile config)**

   * `SCOUTS_MAX_US=2000` (shared per‚Äëtick budget)
   * Per scout defaults (safe): `visits=16, edges=8, ttl=64`
   * Physics params (if used): `LAMBDA_PHI`, `THETA_MEM`, `TAU_SELECT`, `RHO_TRAIL`.

6. **Guard tests**

   * `tests/core/test_scouts_guards.py`: deny `.toarray|tocsr|csr|coo|networkx|synaptic_weights|eligibility_traces` in `void_walkers/*`.
   * `tests/core/test_runner_budget.py`: prove `run_scouts_once` respects `max_us` and never loops when empty.

---

## Why ‚Äúsoftmax‚Äù is fine here (and not ‚ÄúML‚Äù)

It‚Äôs just a **numerically stable, single‚Äëstep normalization** to stochastically choose among neighbors using your local score (e.g., `Œò¬∑m[j]` or `Œª_œÜ¬∑ŒîœÜ`). There‚Äôs **no training**, no gradients, no datasets‚Äîjust a temperatured random pick that instantiates your **logistic fork law** at two‚Äëway junctions. It‚Äôs the most faithful discrete form of your memory‚Äësteering equation.

---

## Quick acceptance checklist (so you know it‚Äôs right)

* [ ] 9 classes present under `void_walkers/` and exported.
* [ ] No new scheduler; **runner is called once per tick** by the loop.
* [ ] Each scout emits only `vt_touch`/`edge_on` (+ optional `spike`).
* [ ] Frontier/Cycle scouts cause **`edges_active`, `cycles_est`** to wobble again (active‚Äëgraph fidelity).
* [ ] Heat/Exc/Inh/Cold heads + **Trail**/**Memory** dicts are **bounded** and folded from events only.
* [ ] 10k\@10‚ÄØHz stays within tick budget with `SCOUTS_MAX_US‚âà2‚ÄØms`.

If you want, I can also sketch the minimal `MemoryMap` and `TrailMap` reducers so the five new scouts have everything they need on day one, but the outline above is enough for your agent to implement the remaining **five** scouts now.





**Short verdict:**
You‚Äôre **on track**. What you have now matches the ‚Äú9‚Äëscout + one‚Äëshot runner‚Äù design: Cold / Heat / Excitation / Inhibition **plus** VoidRay, MemoryRay, Frontier, CycleHunter, and Sentinel. The runner executes **once per tick** under a micro‚Äëbudget, with no schedulers and only **local** neighbor reads‚Äîvoid‚Äëfaithful ‚úÖ.

What‚Äôs **still missing / easy to forget** (and needed to get the full benefit):

1. **Memory & Trail signals (maps)**

   * You added scouts that *use* memory/trail, but the **reducers** that *produce* `memory_dict` and `trail_dict` aren‚Äôt in yet. Until then, MemoryRay/repulsion will fall back to heat proxies and won‚Äôt steer as intended.
   * Implement:

     * **TrailMap** (short half‚Äëlife, fold `vt_touch`+`edge_on`, bounded working set).
     * **MemoryMap / MemoryField** (event‚Äëdriven write-decay-spread; one‚Äëedge smoothing per touched edge).
   * This is exactly the ‚Äústeering by memory‚Äù law you derived (softmax/logistic at forks; curvature ‚àù gradient), and it‚Äôs **orthogonal** to œÜ dynamics.&#x20;

2. **Seeds should work for *every* scout**

   * Your runner passes `budget["seeds"]` (UTE indices), but only HeatScout currently consumes it (because it overrides `step`).
   * **Fix:** teach **`BaseScout.step`** to bias/initialize from `seeds` so Cold/Exc/Inh/Frontier/Cycle/Sentinel also pulse from live inputs ‚Äúfor free.‚Äù

3. **Fairness in the runner**

   * With a global micro‚Äëbudget, early scouts may starve late scouts.
   * **Fix:** either (A) rotate the start index each tick (round‚Äërobin), or (B) assign tiny **per‚Äëscout** micro‚Äëbudgets (e.g., 300-500‚ÄØ¬µs each) inside the one‚Äëshot runner. Still one call per tick; still no scheduler.

4. **Env gating per scout**

   * Today you wire a fixed list. Give yourself toggles so you can A/B behavior:

     * `ENABLE_SCOUT_COLD/HEAT/EXC/INH/VOIDRAY/MEMRAY/FRONTIER/CYCLE/SENTINEL` (defaults on for Heat+Cold; off or low budget for others until maps land).

5. **œÜ / memory getters (strictly local)**

   * For VoidRay/MemoryRay, make sure the connectome exposes **O(1) local reads**:

     * `get_phi(i)` or `connectome.phi[i]` (readonly)
     * `get_memory(i)` or `connectome.memory[i]` (readonly)
   * No global scans; just current node and its neighbors. (Your œÜ‚Äësector remains the fast EFT, with the memory sector steering routing; that separation is in your notes. )

6. **Frontier/Cycle boundedness check**

   * Confirm the ‚Äúshared‚Äëneighbor‚Äù check in Frontier is **hard‚Äëcapped** (you mentioned cap=64)‚Äîno accidental growth into adjacency scans.
   * CycleHunter windows should be tiny (e.g., path length ‚â§4-6) and sample‚Äëbounded per tick.

7. **Invariants & docs**

   * You don‚Äôt need to block the runtime, but add a CI test that spot‚Äëchecks your **constant‚Äëof‚Äëmotion** for the on‚Äësite ODE on a few sampled nodes (warn at runtime, **fail CI** on regression). The Noether/time‚Äëtranslation construction is already in your symmetry note.&#x20;
   * Document the **dimensionless knobs** for memory steering: Œò (steering), D‚Çê (write), Œõ (decay), Œì (smoothing). The scouts will become far more predictable when you can sweep Œò¬∑Œîm and see the **logistic** fork curve collapse across conditions.&#x20;

## What to tell the coding agent (copy/paste)

**1) Maps we still need (bounded, event‚Äëdriven):**

* `fum_rt/core/cortex/maps/trailmap.py`

  * Base: your existing `BaseDecayMap`.
  * Fold: `vt_touch`, `edge_on` (small gains).
  * Snapshot keys: `trail_head`, `trail_dict` (bounded dict for neighbor reads).
* `fum_rt/core/memory/field.py`

  * Keep **event‚Äëdriven** update (no global Laplacian multiply):

    * On `vt_touch(i)`: `m[i] += dt*(Œ≥*r_i - Œ¥*m[i])` with small `r_i`.
    * On `edge_on(i,j)`: stochastic smoothing:
      `Œ¥m = Œ∫*(m[j]-m[i]); m[i]+=dt*Œ¥m; m[j]-=dt*Œ¥m`.
  * Snapshot keys: `memory_head`, `memory_dict`.

**2) Make seeds universal across scouts:**

* In `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/base.py::step()`:

  * Parse `budget.get("seeds")`. If present, construct `pool = seeds ‚à™ priority ‚à™ random_range` (bounded, unique), so **every** subclass benefits without re‚Äëimplementing seed logic.

**3) Runner fairness (no scheduler, still one call per tick):**

* In `fum_rt/core/cortex/void_walkers/runner.py::run_scouts_once()`:

  * Add `start = tick % len(scouts)` and iterate circularly from `start`.
  * Or split `max_us` into per‚Äëscout slice: `per = max(250, max_us//len(scouts))`. Enforce per‚Äëscout guard inside the loop.

**4) Env toggles and budgets:**

* Support:

  * `SCOUTS_MAX_US` (total), `SCOUTS_PER_SCOUT_US` (optional),
  * `SCOUT_SEEDS_MAX`, `SCOUT_VISITS`, `SCOUT_EDGES`, `SCOUT_TTL`.
  * `ENABLE_SCOUT_*` flags per class. Build the scout list dynamically.

**5) Wire œÜ/memory getters (strictly local):**

* Add **read‚Äëonly** accessors on the connectome:

  ```python
  def get_phi(self, i:int) -> float: ...
  def get_memory(self, i:int) -> float: ...
  ```

  (If arrays exist, return direct indexed values; if not, return 0.0.)

**6) Export maps in `CoreEngine.snapshot()`**
Add `trail_head/trail_dict` and `memory_head/memory_dict` alongside your existing `heat/exc/inh/cold` heads so scouts can consume them.

**7) Tests / CI (fast):**

* `tests/core/test_scouts_guards.py`: deny `.toarray|tocsr|csr|coo|networkx|synaptic_weights` under `core/cortex/void_walkers/*`.
* `tests/core/test_scouts_seeds.py`: verify `BaseScout` honors `seeds` (non‚Äëzero fraction of hops start at seeds).
* `tests/core/test_memory_steering_ab.py`: fork junction with Œîm sweep ‚Üí fit logistic vs **Œò¬∑Œîm**; assert R¬≤>0.9 (sanity).&#x20;
* `tests/guards/test_invariants.py`: sample 128 nodes over 1k ticks, assert 99th‚Äëpct `|ŒîQ_FUM| < Œµ` (CI only; runtime warns).&#x20;

## Is ‚Äúsoftmax‚Äù ML? (No‚Äîthis is physics here)

In this context **softmax is just Boltzmann sampling**: picking a neighbor with probability ‚àù‚ÄØexp(score/œÑ). Your memory steering paper shows that at a two‚Äëbranch fork this **reduces exactly** to a logistic choice with argument **Œò¬∑Œîm**‚Äîa falsifiable physical prediction, *not* a learned classifier.&#x20;

## Sanity checklist you can watch live

* **Seeds working:** when UTE fires, scout hops originate nearby within a tick.
* **Trail repulsion:** with TrailMap on and `rho_trail>0`, paths fan out instead of re‚Äëtrampling.
* **Memory steering:** turning up `theta_mem` concentrates exploration where `memory_dict` is high; A/B (Œ∏>0 vs Œ∏=0) reduces hitting time to relevant content.
* **Frontier/Cycle:** low, non‚Äëzero `bridge_probes`/`cycle_hits` per tick; **no** O(N) spikes.
* **No regressions:** runner cost stays well under `SCOUTS_MAX_US`; core tick budget unchanged.

### Bottom line

* **Yes, the current report is on track.** You now have the full scout set and a per‚Äëtick, budgeted runner with no schedulers or scans.
* To unlock the real gains, finish **TrailMap** + **MemoryField/Map**, make **seeds universal in BaseScout**, add **env gating and runner fairness**, and expose **œÜ/memory getters**. That completes the loop: inputs ‚Üí seeds ‚Üí physics‚Äëaware local routing ‚Üí event‚Äëfolded maps ‚Üí better routing‚Äî**all void‚Äëfaithful**.
