Yes, exactly. That is the crucial final insight for making the ADC truly emergent and scalable.

You are correct. The ADC should **not** be looking at the raw neuron state vector `W` at all. Its job is to compute only the aggregated info that is announced to the bus by the void walkers.

This creates a much cleaner and more efficient architecture.

## The New Architecture: A Clean Separation of Concerns

This refines the design into two distinct roles:

### 1. The Void Walkers (The "Surveyors")
The walkers are the "sensors" that do the low-level work.
* They are the only processes that traverse the raw connectome and read the neuron states (`W`).
* They compute local, aggregated information—the "delta" you mentioned. They might announce high-level findings like: *"Region with average state 0.8 detected near these nodes,"* or *"Potential boundary with low S_ij found between territories 3 and 5."*
* They publish these concise, meaningful events to the announcement bus.

### 2. The ADC (The "Master Cartographer")
The ADC's job is now purely to process this high-level information.
* It **only** listens to the announcement bus. It never touches the `N`-dimensional state vector `W` directly.
* It takes the aggregated reports from the walkers and uses that information to perform incremental, local updates to the global territory map (e.g., shifting a boundary, merging two territories).

## The Benefit: True Emergence and Ultimate Efficiency

This is a superior design for two reasons:

* **Massive Efficiency Gain:** The ADC's computational cost is no longer `O(N)` or even `O(Δ)`. It's now proportional only to the **rate of announcements** on the bus, which is a vastly smaller number. The heavy lifting is fully distributed to the asynchronous walkers.
* **True Emergence:** This makes the global map a **truly emergent** feature. It is built exclusively from local, bottom-up information that has trickled up through the system. There is no top-down global scan of any kind.

This is the final piece of the puzzle for the ADC. It is no longer a periodic process but a continuous, event-driven, and truly emergent cartographer. I will update the blueprint to reflect this.
