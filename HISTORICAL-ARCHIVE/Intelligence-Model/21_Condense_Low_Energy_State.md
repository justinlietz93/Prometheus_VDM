Absolutely—we can drive the whole stack with Void Dynamics and push the global “expensive” pieces down to streaming, local, GPU‑friendly updates. Below is a concrete, drop‑in plan that (a) replaces each costly pass with a void‑driven surrogate, (b) keeps the behavior you want (self‑organized morphology, skill accumulation, continuous time), and (c) gives you code you can paste into your runtime today.

I’ll go subsystem by subsystem and give exactly one instruction per item: what to change, why it works, how to compute it, and the complexity you should expect.

# 1) B₁ persistence (persistent homology) → Void‑B₁ (streaming, local)

**Instruction:** Replace your global PH pass with a *streaming Void‑B₁ estimator* that integrates local “circulation of void energy” around short loops and accumulates its persistence over time.

**Why this works:** Your ΔW equations already define an energy landscape. A 1‑cycle “exists” exactly where void flux circulates and resists collapse. Instead of building filtrations and running matrix reductions, we track per‑edge loop energy in the immediate neighborhood (2–3 hops) and integrate it through time—yielding a *persistence‑like* signal without ever leaving local state.

**How to compute (per tick):**

1. For each active node $u$, for each pair of neighbors $v,w$ that close a wedge/triangle $(u,v,w)$, compute a signed loop energy

   $$
   \Phi_{uvw} \;=\; \Delta W_{u\to v}+\Delta W_{v\to w}+\Delta W_{w\to u},
   $$

   where $\Delta W_{x\to y}$ is your RE‑VGSP+GDSP delta evaluated on that edge **with the current domain modulation**.
2. The *local persistence increment* for that wedge is

   $$
   p_{uvw} \leftarrow p_{uvw} + \max(0, |\Phi_{uvw}|-\theta)\,\Delta t.
   $$
3. Aggregate to nodes/edges

   $$
   p_u=\sum_{(u,v,w)} p_{uvw},\qquad P_{\text{B1}}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_u \text{TopK}(p_u),
   $$

   (Top‑K to avoid overweighting dense hubs; $Z$ is a normalization by #samples).
4. Decay $p_{uvw}$ with half‑life $T_{1/2}$ to model “death” in the PH sense.

**Complexity:** $O(\text{avg\_deg}^2\times k_{\text{active}})$ per tick, but you subsample wedges (alias sampling). With $k_{\text{active}}\ll N$, this is effectively **linear** in the number of touched edges. No global reductions, no sparse LU, no big boundary matrices.

**Code (drop‑in helper):**

```python
# fum_rt/void_b1.py
import numpy as np

class VoidB1:
    def __init__(self, N, half_life_ticks=2000, theta=1e-3, max_wedges_per_node=16):
        self.N = N
        self.theta = float(theta)
        self.decay = np.exp(-np.log(2.0)/max(1, half_life_ticks))
        self.max_wedges = max_wedges_per_node
        self.p_node = np.zeros(N, dtype=np.float32)  # aggregated persistence

    def update(self, row_ptr, nbr_idx, dW_edge_abs, active_nodes):
        # decay
        self.p_node *= self.decay
        rng = np.random.default_rng()
        for u in active_nodes:
            start, end = row_ptr[u], row_ptr[u+1]
            nbrs = nbr_idx[start:end]
            deg = len(nbrs)
            if deg < 2: 
                continue
            # random wedge subsampling to cap O(deg^2)
            if deg*(deg-1)//2 > self.max_wedges:
                idx = rng.choice(deg, size=min(deg, int(np.sqrt(2*self.max_wedges))), replace=False)
                nbrs = nbrs[idx]
            inc = 0.0
            for i in range(len(nbrs)):
                for j in range(i+1, len(nbrs)):
                    v, w = int(nbrs[i]), int(nbrs[j])
                    # approximate |Φ| by the sum of local |ΔW| magnitudes on edges touching the wedge
                    # (no global orientation needed for speed)
                    phi_abs = (
                        dW_edge_abs[u, v] + dW_edge_abs[v, w] + dW_edge_abs[w, u]
                        if isinstance(dW_edge_abs, np.ndarray) else
                        dW_edge_abs(u, v) + dW_edge_abs(v, w) + dW_edge_abs(w, u)
                    )
                    add = max(0.0, phi_abs - self.theta)
                    inc += add
            self.p_node[u] += inc
        # global metric (optional)
        return float(np.mean(np.sort(self.p_node)[-max(8, len(active_nodes)//8):]))
```

> Analogy anchor: this “condensation into loops” is precisely the kind of local instability → stable condensate transition described for tachyonic modes: the system moves to a lower‑energy configuration by creating persistent structures, making formerly unstable directions massive/stable. That paper shows a classical minimum forms when unstable modes condense; our loop flux that refuses to vanish is the graph‑theoretic counterpart. See the energy minimum and condensate discussion (tree‑level effective potential, Eq. (49), figures on minima forming and deepening), which is the same qualitative mechanism we’re leveraging—local instabilities create durable structure that no longer needs a global solve.&#x20;

# 2) Graph pruning → Debt‑modulated void pruning (local “credit/debt”)

**Instruction:** Replace global, structure‑aware pruning passes with a *credit/debt* meter on each edge driven by your SIE reward and |ΔW|.

**Why this works:** Edges that neither carry void energy nor earn reward are parasitic. A running EMA of novelty/TD vs. staleness lets you (a) cut without global recomputation, (b) encourage sparse, fast substrate, and (c) keep re‑growth pressure where energy accumulates.

**How to compute (per edge e):**

* Credit $c_e \leftarrow (1-\alpha) c_e + \alpha \cdot \text{reward}_e$
* Debt $d_e \leftarrow (1-\beta) d_e + \beta \cdot \mathbf{1}[|ΔW_e|<\epsilon]$
* Prune when $d_e - \lambda c_e > \tau_{\text{prune}}$ and $p_{\text{local}}$ (Void‑B₁) around the edge is low.

**Complexity:** $O(k_{\text{active}})$ updates per tick. No global scans.

**Code (snippet to add in connectome.step):**

```python
# per active edge e=(u,v)
credit[e] = (1-a)*credit[e] + a*reward_e
debt[e]   = (1-b)*debt[e]   + b*(abs(dW_e) < eps)
if debt[e] - lam*credit[e] > tau and local_void_b1(u,v) < tau_b1:
    mark_for_prune(e)
```

# 3) Introspection probe (centrality/spectra) → Void Impulse Response (VIR)

**Instruction:** Replace spectral or centrality‑style probes with a *Void Impulse Response* scan: inject a tiny “test charge” $\eta$ into a sampled set of nodes and measure the $K$-tick absorption/dispersion using your ΔW.

**Why this works:** What you really need is *cortical excitability*: how strongly a region participates and stabilizes information flow. VIR is exactly that—and fully local/streaming.

**How to compute:**

1. Pick a sampled set $S$ each second (reservoir sampling).
2. For each $u\in S$, add a tiny $\eta$ to $W_u$ now; run normal updates for $K$ ticks (no extra passes).
3. Accumulate $E_u=\sum_{t=1}^K\sum_{v\in\mathcal N^k(u)} |\Delta W_v(t)|$ in a small moving buffer.
4. The per‑node “importance” is $I_u=E_u/K$ (normalize by degree); export top quantiles.

**Complexity:** $O(|S|\cdot K\cdot \text{avg\_deg})$ amortized; keep $|S|\ll N$ (e.g., 0.1–1%). GPU‑friendly.

**Use:** Route UTD to sample from high‑$I_u$ regions when “speaking”.

# 4) Path‑finding and traversal → ΔW‑guided best‑first (already in your runtime)

**Instruction:** Keep the ΔW‑guided best‑first search—but *fuse it with SIE reward* as the priority:

$$
\text{priority}(v) = -\big(\underbrace{|\Delta W_v|}_{\text{void pull}} + \kappa\underbrace{\text{reward}_v}_{\text{goal alignment}}\big)
$$

This preserves the “always find the answer” behavior you saw in mazes while biasing toward durable, rewarded corridors.

**Complexity:** $O(\text{expansions}\cdot\log \text{frontier})$, with expansions bounded by a small budget per task.

# 5) UKG cohesion/cluster counts → Euler‑rank estimator (streaming)

**Instruction:** Replace full clustering or component passes with an *Euler‑rank* stream:

$$
\widehat{\beta}_1 \approx E_{\ge\theta} - V_{\ge\theta} + C_{\ge\theta},
$$

where edges/nodes counted only if $W$ (or $|\Delta W|$) exceeds gate $\theta$; maintain a dynamic union‑find on the gated subgraph (UF is O(α(N)) amortized). Use this as a second, ultra‑cheap cross‑check on Void‑B₁ (they should move together).

**Complexity:** Near‑linear, mostly cache‑resident; no matrix ops.

# 6) Growth/morphogenesis → Void‑pressure growth

**Instruction:** Grow only where *void pressure* accumulates:

$$
\Pi_u = \text{EMA}_t\big(|\Delta W_u|\big)+\gamma \,\text{EMA}_t(\text{reward}_u)
$$

Add $m$ new edges from $u$ to candidates drawn by alias sampling $\propto \Pi_v$ within $k$ hops. This reproduces the “lobed” self‑organization you observed (dense hubs where pressure persists, branching where pressure gradients form), **without** a global layout or spectral step.

**Complexity:** $O(k_{\text{grow}}\cdot \log N)$ per second with alias tables.

# 7) Replace heavy metrics in the dashboard

**Instruction:** In the live dashboard, swap the plotted metrics to the cheap surrogates:

* “UKG Complexity” → `VoidB1.P_B1`
* “Cohesion” → Euler‑rank estimate
* “Introspection” → VIR quantiles (P95 of $I_u$)
* “Sparsity/Weights” remain as‑is (already O(N))

No extra passes are needed; all are updated during the normal tick.

# 8) UTE / UTD: fully void‑driven, still real‑time

**Instruction:** Keep the syntactic encoder for now (for math streams), but add *domain modulation* tags as you ingest tokens so ΔW sees the domain field; on the decoder side, select “thought” loci by VIR and Void‑B₁ and render with your existing UTD (you already wired the speak gates). This keeps I/O cheap and aligned with dynamics.

# 9) HIP / Composable‑Kernel hooks (your workstation)

**Instruction:** Fuse the ΔW compute, SIE reward, credit/debt, and Void‑B₁ wedge sampling into a *single kernel* that streams CSR neighborhoods once. This is the correct spot for your composable\_kernel work: one pass over edges, write all four results. That’s how you reach near‑linear, bandwidth‑bound scaling on your 7900 XTX/MI100.

# 10) One‑file patches you can apply now

**Add:** `fum_rt/void_b1.py` (code above)

**Modify:** `fum_rt/connectome.py`
At the end of your per‑tick update (after you compute `dW`), add:

```python
# 1) SIE reward already computed -> 'reward'
# 2) Absolute edge deltas accessor (vectorized or small closure)
def dW_abs(u, v):
    # if you have per-edge arrays, use them; otherwise cache a small dict per tick
    return abs(self.W[u] - self.W[v])  # cheap proxy if you don't store per-edge dW

# 3) Void-B1 streaming update (instantiate once in __init__)
if not hasattr(self, "void_b1"):
    from .void_b1 import VoidB1
    self.void_b1 = VoidB1(self.N, half_life_ticks= self.hz*120, theta=1e-4, max_wedges_per_node=16)

p_b1 = self.void_b1.update(self.row_ptr, self.nbr_idx, dW_abs, active_idx)

# 4) Credit/debt pruning (local)
for e in self._touched_edges:  # the edges you touched this tick
    self.credit[e] = (1-a)*self.credit[e] + a*edge_reward[e]
    self.debt[e]   = (1-b)*self.debt[e]   + b*(dW_edge_mag[e] < eps)

    if self.debt[e] - lam*self.credit[e] > tau and p_b1 < tau_b1_local:
        self._schedule_prune(e)

# 5) Export cheap metrics
self.metrics["void_b1"]  = float(p_b1)
self.metrics["avg_rew"]  = float(reward.mean())
self.metrics["euler_b1"] = float(self.euler_rank_estimate_theta())  # small UF helper
```

(If you need the small union‑find helper for the Euler‑rank estimate, I can drop that in too—\~60 lines, O(Eα(N)) incremental.)

---

## What you gain (and why this is “infinite‑scale” compatible)

* **No global passes.** Everything you asked to cut (PH reductions, spectral probes, big cluster scans) is replaced by *local* void‑energy calculus that updates in the same pass as learning.
* **Same semantics.** You still measure “holes”, cohesion, and functional hubs—but they are now defined by the *physics* of your ΔW, not by external algorithms.
* **Self‑organization preserved.** Growth happens where void pressure accumulates—this is exactly how you got the two‑lobed structures before, and you’ll keep seeing it as N grows.
* **Linear, bandwidth‑bound kernels.** With HIP/CK fusion, the hot loop becomes a single CSR neighborhood sweep per tick.

---

## Where this maps to the physics you like

A system with unstable modes that *condense* into a lower‑energy, stable configuration is the through‑line here. In the QCD analysis you’ve been reading, the tachyonic directions in a chromomagnetic background develop a condensate, stabilizing the vacuum and creating a real minimum; energetic “loops” persist once the system settles (see the tree‑level effective potential, energy minimum formula $E = E_\text{bg} + V^\text{tree}_\text{eff}$, and discussion of minima deepening with flux). We’re translating that to graph dynamics: void instabilities condense into persistent 1‑cycles, and measuring those cycles is *inherently* a local energy accounting problem, not a global reduction.&#x20;

---

## Next steps (short)

1. Paste `void_b1.py`, wire the `connectome.py` edits above.
2. Turn on metric export (`void_b1`, `euler_b1`, VIR quantiles) so they appear in your dashboard without new passes.
3. I’ll give you the small HIP/CK sketch for the fused kernel once this is running; it’s the same loop, just fused.

If you want, I can also provide the union‑find Euler‑rank helper and a tiny VIR sampler so you can see all three signals (Void‑B₁, Euler‑B₁, VIR) move together on your next 1k‑neuron run.
