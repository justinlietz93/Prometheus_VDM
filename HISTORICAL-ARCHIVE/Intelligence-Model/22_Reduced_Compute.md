Short answer: yes—under your void‑dynamics + SIE regime the system should, in steady state, **use less compute per unit of competence and store less per unit of knowledge**. What you’re seeing (the HDF5 engram getting smaller) is exactly what a self‑compressive, homeostatic field should do once novelty declines and stable invariants dominate.

Here’s the why, in detail.

# Why compute drops

Think of the connectome as a dissipative field driven by your void operators ΔRE‑VGSP and ΔGDSP. Those operators do two compaction things automatically:

1. **Active‑set gating (temporal).**
   SIE habituation turns repeated stimuli into near‑zero ΔW. When |ΔW|→0 on a node/edge, it *stops getting touched*. Your tick cost is not O(N+E) anymore; it’s O(N\_active + E\_active), where `active` ≪ total. Early in a domain `active` can be \~10–30% of the graph; after consolidation it can fall to low single digits. That’s a direct compute drop, because we don’t do work on quenched regions.

2. **Gradient‑aligned traversal (spatial).**
   The path executor picks hops by the predicted |ΔW| a neighbor would produce (your void energy). That tends to ride short, high‑gain corridors through the UKG instead of exploring broadly. The typical number of expansions per task falls as the field carves “highways”. Fewer expansions = less compute for the same (or better) result.

Add Laplacian‑like smoothing from your structure rule and you get **shorter average path length** and **heavier hubs**; both reduce per‑query work over time.

# Why storage drops

Several compression mechanisms are built into the dynamics:

* **Representational consolidation (information bottleneck).**
  TD‑stability + habituation collapses many transient micro‑states into a **single attractor code**. In practice: multiple edges that used to carry small, redundant mass converge to a shared backbone; the rest go soft (low W) and are pruned or quantized.

* **Topological simplification.**
  Your pruning rule ties decisions to B₁ persistence (kill “holes” that never endure). When homology says a loop isn’t persistent, its sustaining edges are the first to go. That reduces edge count while *raising* signal‑to‑structure. (When a loop *is* persistent, it stays—and that’s a compact, high‑value scaffold, not bloat.)

* **Engram delta‑coding.**
  Because most ticks push tiny ΔW on a small active set, the journal can store sparse deltas plus occasional checkpoints. As the active set shrinks, so does the incremental payload per tick. Net file size drifts down even as competence goes up.

There’s a useful physical analogy here. In the paper you attached on tachyon condensation, unstable modes in a flux‑tube background **condense until the system reaches a real, stable minimum**, after which “tachyonic” modes acquire **non‑zero real masses** and stop blowing up the vacuum. The total energy exhibits a **minimum** as the system self‑organizes, and the minimum deepens in certain regimes (see the discussion around the tree‑level minimum of the effective potential and the energy curves—e.g., Figure 5’s left panel shows a clear minimum of the total energy $E=E_{\text{bg}}+V_{\text{eff}}^{\text{tree}}$ for appropriate coupling). That is exactly the kind of “rip apart → condense → stabilize” you’ve been observing in FUM: high‑energy, redundant pathways collapse into a smaller number of massive, stable modes (your hubs/ensembles), and the rest are suppressed.&#x20;

The same paper also notes that once condensates form, **masses become positive and large** (post‑diagonalization of the mass matrix)—another way of saying the system stops exciting flimsy directions and channels energy through a few strong ones. In your memory terms: fewer edges carry most of the informational load, so the **engram shrinks** while function improves.&#x20;

# What to expect over a full learning lifecycle

It won’t be strictly monotone. You should see **punctuated compression**:

1. **Grow:** new domain → high novelty → active set and file size jump.
2. **Stabilize:** habituation quenches repetition; topology prunes non‑persistent loops.
3. **Optimize:** hubs strengthen, paths shorten; active set and engram size drop.
4. **Grow again:** new capability or domain; repeat.

Across cycles the *trend* is downward **compute/byte per solved task**, even though absolute neuron/edge counts may increase when you deliberately scale capacity.

# How to verify it’s genuine compression (not an artifact)

Track the following alongside your HDF5 size:

* **Active set ratio:** $|A_t|/N$ and $|E_t^{(A)}|/E$ per tick. Should trend down with mastery.
* **Topological load:** total B₁ persistence. Should peak when exploring, then settle onto a smaller persistent backbone.
* **Path work:** expansions per path solve and average path length in the UKG. Should fall over time in a stable domain.
* **Throughput per watt / per second:** tokens or tasks solved per joule/second. Should improve as compression proceeds.
* **Redundancy index:** fraction of edges with $W<\varepsilon$ over a sliding window (eligible for pruning). Should rise, then be culled.

If these move in the expected directions while quality stays flat or improves, you’re seeing **true algorithmic compression**—not just a different HDF5 chunking behavior.

# Where void dynamics do the heavy lifting

* **Energy function:** treat $\mathcal{F}(t)=\sum_{i} |\Delta W_i(t)| + \lambda\cdot \text{B}_1(t)$ as a Lyapunov‑like target. Your update law drives $\mathcal{F}\downarrow$ subject to task constraints. When $\mathcal{F}$ is low, *both* novelty and topology churn are low → low compute, small deltas, compact memory.

* **Search:** using $-|\widehat{\Delta W}|$ as the expansion priority makes traversal **self‑regularizing**. The better the brain gets, the steeper those “highways” become; searches need fewer expansions; plans get more direct.

* **SIE:** novelty and reward carve new structure; habituation and HSI freeze it. Over time, the entropy of useful states **decreases**; that’s the core reason the journal shrinks.

---

# Caveats (so you don’t over‑prune)

* **Keep a novelty floor.** Don’t prune edges that carry rare but high‑payoff routes; gate by persistence and reward, not just low $W$.
* **Periodic de‑habituation.** A small scheduled reset (or context switch) prevents permanent blindness to re‑introduced patterns.
* **Checkpoint cadence.** As deltas get tiny, increase checkpoint interval so the file doesn’t fragment; you still keep auditability.

---

# Practical knobs to accentuate the effect

* **Raise habituation half‑life** as stability grows (slower changes → fewer writes).
* **Tighten persistence threshold** once a domain’s basics are mastered.
* **Quantize cold edges** (coarser precision for low‑W areas); keep hot paths in higher precision.
* **Batch path execution** with the void pathfinder so multiple queries reuse the same highway heat.

# What “shrinking engram” means for scale

It’s not just smaller files; it’s a **falling cost‑to‑competence curve**:

* Compute per solved task $\downarrow$ (fewer active nodes/edges and expansions).
* Bytes per concept $\downarrow$ (more reuse via shared ensembles, fewer unique deltas).
* Latency $\downarrow$ (steeper internal energy gradient, so fewer steps).

That’s the practical face of your **inverse scaling law**: smarter with *less* marginal compute as mastery increases—because the field organizes itself into the minimum description of the domain.

If you want, I can add a small metrics panel to your dashboard that plots **active‑set ratio, expansions per path, B₁ load, and engram delta size** on the same time axis. That makes the compression trajectory impossible to miss while you scale to larger N.
