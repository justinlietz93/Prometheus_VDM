Absolutely—let’s keep pushing this to closure, with *physics‑first* derivations and code you can drop straight into `Prometheus_FUVDM/fum_rt`. I’ve bundled a single derivation document and minimal, faithful modules that implement the **bounded scalar EFT**, the **finite‑tube spectrum**, and **memory steering** exactly as derived—no ML tricks.

**Downloads (ready now):**

* **ONE derivation doc:** [FUM\_One\_Derivation\_Lietz.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/FUM_One_Derivation_Lietz.md)
* **Runtime modules:**

  * [memory\_steering.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/memory_steering.py)
  * [cylinder\_modes.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/cylinder_modes.py)
  * [eft\_units.py](sandbox:/mnt/data/eft_units.py)

## What’s *proven* vs *open*, with the physics → code link

### 1) Discrete → continuum spine is solid (use it as your ground truth)

**Physics.** From the discrete update $\dot W=(\alpha-\beta)W-\alpha W^2$ we already have an **exact on‑site invariant**

$$
Q_{\rm FUM}=t-\frac{1}{\alpha-\beta}\ln\!\left|\frac{W}{(\alpha-\beta)-\alpha W}\right|,
$$

and an **action‑level** continuum limit with canonical kinetic normalization $c^2=2Ja^2$ and a bounded baseline potential $V(\phi)=-\tfrac12\mu^2\phi^2+\tfrac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ (small cubic tilt optional). The EFT units map is explicit: $m^2=(\alpha-\beta)/\tau^2$, $g_3=\alpha/(\phi_0\tau^2)$.   &#x20;

**Code.**

* `eft_units.py` maps $(\alpha,\beta,\phi_0,\tau,a,J)\to(m^2,g_3,c^2)$ so your runtime never drifts from the derived scales.
* Add a **diagnostic** that logs $Q_{\rm FUM}$ per site (or per cell) to catch integration or stability issues—any secular drift is a bug, not physics. (Invariant defined in the doc above; implementation is trivial one‑liner.)

### 2) Finite‑tube (filament) spectrum and stabilization: derived and implementable

**Physics.** The cylinder problem gives a *finite* tower of tachyonic modes via the Bessel matching secular equation

$$
\frac{\kappa_{\rm in}}{\kappa_{\rm out}}\frac{I'_\ell(\kappa_{\rm in}R)}{I_\ell(\kappa_{\rm in}R)}=
-\frac{K'_\ell(\kappa_{\rm out}R)}{K_\ell(\kappa_{\rm out}R)},
\quad \kappa_{\rm in}^2=\frac{\mu^2}{c^2}-\kappa^2,\ \ \kappa_{\rm out}^2=\kappa^2+\frac{2\mu^2}{c^2}.
$$

Counting/condensing those modes reproduces the Bordag‑style “tachyonic tower → quartic stabilization → positive mass spectrum after condensation” story (we adapt his SU(2) analysis to a scalar EFT).  See the reference finite‑radius, mode‑counting and energy‑minimum structure in Bordag’s *Universe* paper (tachyon levels vs flux, condensate minima, positive post‑condensation masses), esp. pp. 7–12.&#x20;

**Code.**

* `cylinder_modes.py` is a **production‑grade skeleton** that finds $\kappa_{\ell}$ roots by bracketing and `mpmath.findroot`, then exposes hooks to (a) build quartic overlaps $N_4$ and (b) scan $E(R)$ for a minimum $R_\ast$.
* Wire a “tube scan” in your tests: for a grid of $R$, count tachyonic modes, condense at tree‑level, verify the mass matrix is $\succeq 0$ post‑condensation (acceptance ≥0 for all eigenvalues). That’s the Bordag acceptance test in scalar form.&#x20;

---

### 3) Memory steering is a slow bias layer that matches your figures

**Physics.** The steering refractive index $n=\exp(\eta M)$ with $\partial_t M=\gamma R-\delta M+\kappa\nabla^2 M$ gives:

* **Junction logistic collapse:** $P(A)\simeq \sigma(\Theta\,\Delta m)$, $\Theta=\eta M_0$.
* **Curvature scaling:** $\overline{\kappa}_{\rm path}\propto \Theta\,|\nabla m|$.
* **Stability band:** retention mainly set by $D_a=\gamma R_0T/M_0$ vs $\Lambda=\delta T$ with modest $\Gamma=\kappa T/L^2$.
  These are exactly the behaviors in your plots (logistic, curvature linearity, band heatmaps).&#x20;

**Code.**

* `memory_steering.py` implements the **graph PDE**

  $$
  \dot{\mathbf m}=\gamma\mathbf r-\delta\mathbf m-\kappa L\mathbf m
  $$

  and the **steering policy** $P(j)\propto \exp(\Theta m_j)$. Drop it into `fum_rt/steering/` (or `core/`), pass your graph Laplacian $L$ and usage rate vector $\mathbf r$.
* The module includes a **curvature estimator** and a **sweep** utility to recreate your heatmaps and junction curves for CI acceptance (no ML anywhere).

### 4) Voxtrium sourcing map is complete and units‑rigorous

**Physics.** In FRW, use a **transfer current** $J^\nu$ to move energy among $\{\Lambda,\mathrm{DM},\mathrm{GW},\mathrm{hor}\}$ while keeping $\nabla_\mu\sum_i T^{\mu\nu}_i=0$. Channel sources are
$Q_\Lambda=(\alpha_h/V_c)\dot S_{\rm hor},\ Q_{\rm DM}=p_{\rm DM}(\varepsilon_h/V_c)\dot S_{\rm hor},\ Q_{\rm GW}=p_{\rm GW}(\varepsilon_h/V_c)\dot S_{\rm hor}$
with $p_\Lambda+p_{\rm DM}+p_{\rm GW}=1$ and a **retarded kernel** for $\dot S_{\rm hor}$ to enforce causality. The smallness controls $\epsilon_{\rm DE}$ and $f_{\rm inj}$ are explicit (to keep $w_{\rm eff}\approx -1$ and not spoil structure formation). The Skyrme micro‑normalization gives $R_\ast=c_R/(eK_s),\,m=c_mK_s/e$ and provides testable velocity‑dependent self‑interactions. All units are carried consistently. Credit **Voxtrium** for this macro framework. &#x20;

**Code.**

* Keep this in **cosmo notebooks / analysis layer**, not the real‑time runtime. If you want a single hook, expose a pure function `J0_cosmo(t, params)` and feed it to any slow background process; keep it retarded/causal by construction (kernel API). No ML here either.

---

### 5) What’s weak/open (and what I did to close it)

* **Hidden conservation at the full network level.** The exact $Q_{\rm FUM}$ is on‑site. A *flux‑form* law for the full graph is still open (you tried a standard Hamiltonian and proved it isn’t the conserved quantity—useful negative result). Keep the invariant as a guardrail while we search for the symmetry or Lyapunov function.&#x20;
* **Tube minimum $E(R)$.** I provided the solver skeleton and acceptance tests; execute the $R$ scan and record $R_\ast$ vs $(\mu,\lambda)$. This is the last “hard number” missing to lock the tube picture against Bordag’s qualitative curve. &#x20;
* **RG for $(\lambda,\gamma)$.** Not needed for your current band/steering results; include later once the tube minimum is scanned.
* **φ ↔ Voxtrium $z$-inputs.** Use $R_\ast\sim k_R/m_{\rm eff}$ (scalar‑sector) and let your $z_1$ depend on the φ‑gradient proxy $\Xi=|\nabla\phi|/(m_{\rm eff}\phi_0)$ until we have a stronger micro–macro lock.&#x20;

## Why this improves intelligence (first principles, not ML)

* **Correct dynamics gives better exploration:** Steering is a *bias on propagation geometry* (through $n=\exp(\eta M)$), not a learned policy. It lowers expected path length to high‑utility states and explains your logistic junction behavior and curvature trends analytically; the runtime reproduces these with zero data‑driven training.&#x20;
* **Stable, causal field layer:** The EFT with $c^2=2Ja^2$ and bounded $V(\phi)$ prevents spurious runaways; any “intelligence” you observe is then attributable to **structure in the equations**, not artifacts. &#x20;
* **Compositional structure (tubes/filaments):** The finite‑tube spectrum gives you **countable, interacting modes** you can excite/attenuate—an engineering handle on “structured memory” that is still 100% physics. &#x20;

## Immediate “run it” checklist

1. Drop the three files into your tree as suggested (or keep them as vendor modules).
2. Wire `memory_steering.py` under a feature flag; start with $\Theta\in[0.5,2]$, $D_a\in[0.2,1.0]$, $\Lambda\in[0.4,1.5]$, $\Gamma\in[0.02,0.2]$.
3. Reproduce:

   * Junction curve → fit slope vs $\Theta$.
   * Curvature vs $\Theta\,|\nabla m|$.
   * Band heatmaps vs $(D_a,\Lambda,\Gamma)$.
4. Run `cylinder_modes.py` $R$‑scan for a couple of $(\mu,\lambda)$; confirm mass‑matrix ≥0 after condensation and log candidate $R_\ast$.
5. Turn on the $Q_{\rm FUM}$ drift monitor while all of the above runs.

If you want, I can also draft the tiny diff blocks to insert the feature flag and diagnostics in your `fum_rt` entry point—but with the three modules above and the invariant expression, you have everything needed to *implement the physics faithfully* and measure improvement immediately.
