Below, I'll begin working on your physics by creating rigorous derivations for some of the key gaps identified in the latest GPT-5 documents (e.g., 10_GPT5_..., 18_GPT5_..., etc.) and synthesizing them with the existing framework from your codebase/docs (e.g., discrete_to_continuum.md, symmetry_analysis.md, kinetic_term_derivation.md, fum_voxtrium_mapping.md, memory_steering.md, finite_tube_mode_analysis.md). I'll approach this as an AI Physicist: starting from first principles, breaking down the problems methodically, and ensuring transparency in the mathematics. I'll prioritize gaps that are foundational and frequently referenced, such as:

1. **The missing discrete conservation law** (or its absence, with a Lyapunov functional as fallback) – this is a recurring "open" item across docs like 10_GPT5, 16_GPT5, and symmetry_analysis.md.
2. **Bounding higher-derivative terms in the EFT** – emphasized in effective_field_theory_approach.md and kinetic_term_derivation.md for rigor.
3. **Hydrodynamic limit from the scalar field** – flagged in 15_GPT5 as a way to derive emergent fluid behavior (e.g., for "intelligence" via structured flows).

I'll derive these step-by-step, with symbolic computations where needed (using the code_execution tool for verification). For each, I'll provide:
- A formal derivation.
- Ties to your existing work.
- Code stubs for integration into fum_rt (e.g., diagnostics.py or new modules).
- Falsifiable tests or acceptance criteria.

If these close the most pressing gaps, great; otherwise, let me know which to tackle next (e.g., full multi-mode tube condensation Hessian or memory steering extensions). I'll aim for modularity so these drop in without disrupting your core loop.

### 1. Derivation: The Missing Discrete Conservation Law (Negative Result + Lyapunov Functional)
**Context from Docs**: Your symmetry_analysis.md derives the on-site invariant \( Q_{\text{FUM}} = t - \frac{1}{\alpha - \beta} \ln \left| \frac{W}{(\alpha - \beta) - \alpha W} \right| \) from time-translation symmetry, but notes no standard translational/rotational symmetries. Docs like 10_GPT5 and discrete_conservation.md highlight that the naive Hamiltonian \(\mathcal{H}_i = \frac{1}{2} (\dot{W}_i)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} J (W_j - W_i)^2 + V(W_i)\) is *not* conserved, suggesting the system is dissipative. We need to either find a hidden conserved quantity or prove a Lyapunov functional for stability.

**First-Principles Approach**: Start with the discrete update rule on the kNN graph (from connectome.py):
\[
\dot{W}_i = F(W_i) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} J_{ij} (W_j - W_i),
\]
where \( F(W_i) = (\alpha - \beta) W_i - \alpha W_i^2 \) (on-site, from FUM_Void_Equations.py stub), and the sum is the interaction term (Laplacian-like, from kinetic_term_derivation.md).

To search for a conserved quantity \( Q = \sum_i Q_i(W_i, \dot{W}_i, \{W_j\}) \), require \( \dot{Q} = 0 \) under the dynamics. Test candidates via Noether-like symmetry or direct computation.

**Step 1: Test for Global Energy-Like Conservation**.
Assume a candidate \( Q = \sum_i \left[ \frac{1}{2} \dot{W}_i^2 + V(W_i) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} J_{ij} (W_i - W_j)^2 \right] \), with \( V(W_i) = \int F(W_i) dW_i = \frac{\alpha - \beta}{2} W_i^2 - \frac{\alpha}{3} W_i^3 \) (integrated from the ODE, per symmetry_analysis.md).

Compute \( \dot{Q} = \sum_i \dot{W}_i \ddot{W}_i + \sum_i \dot{W}_i F(W_i) + \sum_i \sum_{j} J_{ij} \dot{W}_i (W_i - W_j) + \dots \) (full expansion is messy; focus on on-site).

From docs (discrete_conservation.md), the on-site part alone gives \( \frac{\Delta (\mathcal{K}_i + \mathcal{V}_i)}{\Delta t} \approx [F(W_i)]^2 \left( \frac{dF}{dW_i} - 1 \right) = [F(W_i)]^2 ((\alpha - \beta) - 2\alpha W_i - 1) \neq 0 \). Interaction terms don't cancel this exactly (as proven in your negative result), so no flux-form conservation like \( \partial_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0 \).

**Verification via Tool**: To confirm the non-zero \( \dot{Q} \), I executed a symbolic computation.

### Progress on Your Physics: Derivations for Key Gaps
Thank you for sharing the latest GPT-5 documents—they provide excellent scaffolding, building on your existing work (e.g., discrete_to_continuum.md for the baseline EFT, symmetry_analysis.md for the on-site invariant, kinetic_term_derivation.md for dispersion, fum_voxtrium_mapping.md for units/causality, memory_steering.md for steering laws, and finite_tube_mode_analysis.md for mode counting). As an AI Physicist, I'm excited to dive in: I'll approach this inquisitively, from first principles, ensuring each derivation is methodical, transparent, and tied to empirical/testable criteria. I'll synthesize the GPT-5 insights (e.g., kinetic constancy, Lyapunov structures, tube condensation) with your prior framework to create new, self-contained derivations for high-priority gaps.

From the docs, recurring gaps include:
- **Conservation/dissipation structure** (e.g., no naive Hamiltonian; need Lyapunov or hidden invariant).
- **EFT rigor** (bounding higher-derivative terms explicitly).
- **Hydrodynamic/emergent flow limits** (for "intelligence" via structured dynamics).
- **Finite-tube extensions** (e.g., full Hessian post-condensation).

I'll begin with the first three (foundational), deriving them formally with symbolic verification (using tools). For each, I'll provide:
- A rigorous derivation.
- Links to your docs/GPT-5 claims.
- Code stubs for fum_rt integration.
- Falsifiable tests.

This is a starting point—let me know if you want more (e.g., tube Hessian next) or refinements.

#### Gap 1: Resolving the Missing Discrete Conservation Law (Dissipative Structure with Lyapunov Functional)
**Context Synthesis**: symmetry_analysis.md derives the on-site \( Q_{\text{FUM}} = t - \frac{1}{\alpha - \beta} \ln \left| \frac{W}{(\alpha - \beta) - \alpha W} \right| \), but notes no translational symmetry. discrete_conservation.md proves the naive Hamiltonian isn't conserved. GPT-5 docs (e.g., 10_GPT5, 16_GPT5) suggest pivoting to a Lyapunov functional for dissipation, as the UV model is open but IR-conservative via EFT.

**Derivation from First Principles**:
Start with the discrete dynamics on the connectome graph (kNN, from core/connectome.py):
\[
\dot{W}_i = F(W_i) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} J_{ij} (W_j - W_i),
\]
where \( F(W_i) = (\alpha - \beta) W_i - \alpha W_i^2 \) is the nonlinear on-site term (from void equations), and the sum is diffusive coupling (Laplacian analog, per kinetic_term_derivation.md).

To find a conserved Q, require \( \dot{Q} = 0 \) for Q = ∑_i Q_i. Test symmetry (Noether): no shift symmetry (W → W + c changes F), no scaling symmetry (W → λW scales F nonlinearly). Thus, no simple momentum/energy conservation.

Instead, prove it's a gradient flow with Lyapunov L decreasing to equilibria. Candidate:
\[
L = \sum_i V(W_i) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} J_{ij} (W_i - W_j)^2,
\]
where \( V(W_i) = \int^{W_i} -F(u) du = -\frac{(\alpha - \beta)}{2} W_i^2 + \frac{\alpha}{3} W_i^3 \) (note sign for descent; bounded per discrete_to_continuum.md).

Compute \( \dot{L} = \sum_i \dot{W}_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial W_i} = \sum_i \dot{W}_i (-F(W_i) + \sum_j J_{ij} (W_i - W_j)) \).

Substitute dynamics: \( \dot{L} = -\sum_i [\dot{W}_i - \sum_j J_{ij} (W_j - W_i)]^2 - \sum_i \sum_j J_{ij} (W_i - W_j)^2 \leq 0 \).

Equality at fixed points where \( \dot{W}_i = 0 \), i.e., uniform W = (α - β)/α (stable vacuum). This shows dissipative relaxation, consistent with GPT-5's "UV dissipative, IR Hamiltonian."

**Symbolic Verification** (tool-confirmed integration of V):
