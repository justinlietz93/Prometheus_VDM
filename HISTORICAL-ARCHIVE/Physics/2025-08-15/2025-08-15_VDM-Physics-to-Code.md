Justin - below is a compact, *physics → code → tests* continuation that closes the next set of gaps you flagged (hydrodynamic limit, dissipation bookkeeping, and the protein‑folding/functional dynamics analogy), and makes the upgrades explicit for your `fum_rt` runtime. I keep it first‑principles and tie every statement back to your derivations; where Bordag’s vortex analysis is used, I credit Voxtrium/Bordag.

## 0) What is already on firm ground in your notes

* **Continuum EFT from the discrete rule.** You have a clean, action‑level derivation of the scalar with canonical kinetic term $\tfrac12(\partial_t\phi)^2-\tfrac{c^2}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2$ and $c^2=2Ja^2$ (no microscopic constraint tying $J$ to $a$); Euler-Lagrange gives $\partial_t^2\phi-c^2\nabla^2\phi+V'(\phi)=0$.&#x20;
  The discrete‑to‑continuum write‑up makes the bounded quartic baseline explicit with optional small cubic tilt that maps to your $(\alpha,\beta)$.
* **Conservation/structure of the on‑site dynamics.** Time‑translation invariance of the autonomous ODE gives an exact integral $Q_{\text{FUM}}=t-\!\int dW/F(W)$ (a constant of motion for the *trajectory clock*, not a Hamiltonian), and the on‑site Lyapunov drop $\dot V(W)=-F(W)^2\le0$ was established in your discrete conservation analysis. This is the right lens (dissipative flow), not a naive energy conservation.
* **Finite‑tube instability and stabilization.** Your Bordag‑inspired cylinder analysis (credit: Voxtrium → Bordag) shows how a finite‑radius “false‑vacuum” core supports tachyonic modes that condense to non‑negative masses after quartic stabilization; counting and matching conditions are spelled out with the Bessel secular equation.
* **Memory steering is dimensionless, falsifiable.** The eikonal law $n=\exp(\eta M)\Rightarrow \kappa_{\text{path}}=\eta\,|\nabla_\perp M|$ and the write-decay-spread PDE $\partial_t M=\gamma R-\delta M+\kappa\nabla^2M$ are formalized, with non‑dimensional groups $\Theta=\eta M_0$, $D_a=\gamma R_0T/M_0$, $\Lambda=\delta T$, $\Gamma=\kappa T/L^2$. Junction logistic and curvature‑scaling collapses follow immediately.&#x20;
* **Units‑rigorous bridge to Voxtrium.** Physical scalings $(\phi_0,\tau,a)$, retarded kernels for causal sourcing, and FRW transfer‑current bookkeeping are laid out; Λ/DM/GW partitions live on a probability simplex with micro‑informed inputs. (Credit Voxtrium.)

These pieces are solid and we will build directly on them.

## 1) Hydrodynamic limit you can *prove* (and implement)

### 1.1 Minimal U(1) extension → superfluid‑type hydrodynamics (best‑controlled path)

**Physics.** Promote your real $\phi$ to a **complex** scalar $\Psi=\sqrt{\rho}\,e^{i\theta}$ with the canonical Lagrangian

$$
\mathcal L=\tfrac12\,\partial_\mu\Psi^\ast\,\partial^\mu\Psi - V(|\Psi|)\quad \text{with }V=\tfrac{\lambda}{4}(|\Psi|^2-v^2)^2+\text{(small cubic tilt)}.
$$

This is the smallest change that **keeps** your kinetic normalization and quartic stabilization while adding a continuous phase. Varying the action and writing in Madelung variables yields (to leading gradient order)

$$
\partial_t \rho+\nabla\!\cdot(\rho\,\mathbf u)=0,\qquad 
(\partial_t+\mathbf u\!\cdot\nabla)\mathbf u=-\nabla h(\rho)+\underbrace{\nabla\!\Big(\tfrac{\nabla^2\sqrt{\rho}}{2\sqrt{\rho}}\Big)}_{\text{quantum pressure}},
$$

with velocity $\mathbf u\equiv \nabla\theta$ and enthalpy $h'(\rho)=V'(\sqrt{\rho})/\sqrt{\rho}$. This is the standard superfluid hydrodynamic limit of a complex scalar and is completely consistent with your EFT scaffolding (same $c^2=2Ja^2$; you can set $c=1$ by units as before).

**Why this matters.** It gives you *derivable* continuity and Euler‑type equations (compressible fluid) from your action, not an analogy. It also cleanly explains tube kinematics: vorticity is quantized where $\theta$ winds; tubes/filaments are natural phase‑defect supports.

**Code hook (new module `physics/superfluid.py`).**

```python
# state: rho[i], theta[i] on graph; edges E with length a
# currents and updates (leapfrog)
j_ij = 0.5*(rho[i]+rho[j]) * (theta[j]-theta[i]) / a           # edge current
div_j[i] = sum_{j in N(i)} s_ij * j_ij / a                     # discrete divergence with signs
rho_next[i]   = rho[i] - dt * div_j[i]
theta_next[i] = theta[i] - dt * ( h_prime(rho[i]) \
                     - quantum_pressure(rho, i, a) )
```

Where `quantum_pressure` is the standard discrete Laplacian on $\sqrt{\rho}$. Tie $a,\ dt$ to your existing units map ($\tau,a$).&#x20;

### 1.2 Incompressible or viscous behavior

* **Viscosity from memory coupling.** Couple the slow memory field $M$ into the phase dynamics as a weak Rayleigh dissipation functional $\mathcal R=\frac{\nu(M)}{2}\,(\nabla\theta)^2$. This adds a term $-\nu(M)\nabla^2\mathbf u$ to the Euler equation (Navier-Stokes form). Choose $\nu(M)=\nu_0+\nu_1\,(\Gamma,\Lambda)$ consistent with your dimensionless groups so that stronger smoothing ($\Gamma$) increases effective viscosity and large forgetting ($\Lambda$) suppresses it.&#x20;
* **Incompressible projection (optional).** If you need the $\nabla\!\cdot\mathbf u=0$ limit, apply a Helmholtz projection to the discrete velocity at each step; the complex scalar still gives you the *source* of vorticity (defect lines), but you enforce incompressibility numerically.

**Acceptance tests.**
(1) Sound speed from small $\rho$ perturbations matches $c$ from your kinetic derivation.&#x20;
(2) Vortex line energy scales logarithmically with core size set by the tube analysis (Sec. 3).&#x20;

---

## 2) Dissipation is a feature - make it an accounting identity

Your discrete analysis already shows the on‑site potential $V(W)$ is a **Lyapunov** function: $dV/dt=-F(W)^2\le0$ for $F(W)=(\alpha-\beta)W-\alpha W^2$. That proves the microdynamics are *dissipative* (not Hamiltonian). Use it.&#x20;

### 2.1 Physics identity (per tick)

Define the per‑node **dissipation ledger**

$$
\dot{\mathcal D}_i \;\equiv\; [F(W_i)]^2 \quad (\ge 0),
$$

so that

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\Big(\sum_i V(W_i)\Big) \;=\; - \sum_i \dot{\mathcal D}_i \;+\; \Phi_{\text{int}},
$$

with $\Phi_{\text{int}}$ the change in interaction/gradient energy (exactly your Eq. (9) term); do **not** force $\Phi_{\text{int}}$ to cancel: it transports energy across edges. This gives you a clean **split**: local loss $\dot{\mathcal D}$ (to “void heat”) + neighbor transport.&#x20;

### 2.2 Voxtrium bridge (credit)

Aggregate $\sum_i \dot{\mathcal D}_i$ over a comoving cell to define a *local* entropy‑production density $s_{\rm loc}$. Feed it through the **retarded kernel** to the FRW transfer current $J^\nu$, exactly as your units‑rigorous Voxtrium mapping prescribes:

$$
J^0(x,t) \;=\; \int\!\!d^3x'\!\int_{-\infty}^{t}\!\!dt'\;K_{\rm ret}(t-t',|\mathbf x-\mathbf x'|)\,s_{\rm loc}(x',t').
$$

This keeps causality and ties dissipation to macro sources without violating covariant conservation. (All units and partition closure already specified.)

**Code hook (`physics/ledger.py`).**

```python
def local_dissipation(W, alpha, beta):
    F = (alpha-beta)*W - alpha*W*W
    return F*F      # per node, per unit time

def accumulate_entropy(cell_nodes, W, alpha, beta, dt):
    return dt * sum(local_dissipation(W[i], alpha, beta) for i in cell_nodes)
```

## 3) “Protein folding” upgraded from analogy → mechanism

What proteins do (minimize a free energy with bending + interaction terms) is exactly what your **tube mode** analysis does in the EFT: a set of unstable modes condense and then interact via quartics; the tree‑level Hessian is positive after condensation. (Your notes mirror Bordag’s Eq. (secular condition) and energy minimum vs. control; credit Voxtrium/Bordag.)

### 3.1 Functional you can minimize on a graph

Define a curve $\gamma(s)$ (a “filament” path) and a *void‑hydro* free energy

$$
\mathcal F[\gamma] \;=\; \int\!ds\;\Big\{\underbrace{\sigma}_{\text{tension}} 
+ \underbrace{\tfrac{\chi}{2}\kappa(s)^2}_{\text{bending}} 
\;-\; \underbrace{\Theta\,M(\gamma(s))}_{\text{memory attraction}}\Big\},
$$

with curvature $\kappa$ and $\Theta=\eta M_0$ from the memory law. The Euler-Lagrange equation gives the **shape** equation

$$
\chi\,\gamma'''' - \sigma\,\gamma'' + \Theta\,\nabla_\perp M = 0,
$$

whose *ray limit* ($\chi\!\to\!0$) collapses to your proven steering law $\kappa=\Theta\,|\nabla_\perp M|$ (your curvature scaling plots).&#x20;
This is the exact upgrade: you now predict *stable shapes* (folded, looped tubes) and their response to $M$‑gradients, not just path curvature.

**Code hook (`physics/folding.py`).** Discrete elastic‑curve descent on the graph:

```python
# nodes p[k] along a polyline; compute curvature and memory force
kappa_k = 2*np.sin(theta_k/2)/ell      # your calibrated estimator
F_bend  = -chi * discrete_biharmonic(p)  # standard elastic curve operator
F_tens  = -sigma * discrete_laplacian(p)
F_mem   = +Theta * grad_M_perp(p)
p_next  = p + dt * (F_bend + F_tens + F_mem)
```

Stop when $\max_k\|\Delta p_k\|$ falls below tolerance → a folded, memory‑functional tube.

## 4) Putting it together in `fum_rt` (no ML, just physics)

### 4.1 Minimal PR outline (atomic commits)

1. **`physics/units.py`** - centralize $(\phi_0,\tau,a)$, expose $c^2=2Ja^2$.&#x20;
2. **`physics/memory.py`** - implement $\partial_t M=\gamma R-\delta M+\kappa\nabla^2M$ on the graph and the *softmax steering* that reproduces your junction sigmoid exactly:
   $P(i\!\to\!j)=\exp(\Theta m_j)/\sum_{k\in N(i)}\exp(\Theta m_k)$. (Your logistic collapse follows.)&#x20;
3. **`physics/superfluid.py`** - complex scalar hydrodynamics as in §1.1; optional viscous term $\nu(M)\nabla^2\mathbf u$.&#x20;
4. **`physics/folding.py`** - elastic‑curve descent for tube shapes (§3.1).&#x20;
5. **`physics/tubes.py`** - Bordag‑style radial solver + condensate Hessian checker, using your secular equation (count unstable modes vs. $R$, then show all post‑condensation eigenvalues $\ge 0$). (Credit Voxtrium/Bordag.)
6. **`physics/ledger.py`** - dissipation accounting and (optional) retarded‑kernel aggregator to Voxtrium $J^\nu$.
7. **`core/diagnostics.py`** - report dimensionless groups $(\Theta,D_a,\Lambda,\Gamma)$, stability band plots (retention vs. $\Lambda$, fidelity vs. $\Gamma$) to match your figures.&#x20;

### 4.2 Integration points

* **Router**: Replace any ad‑hoc heuristics with the *softmax‑by‑memory* transition (already implied by your theory) so junction choices obey $P=\sigma(\Theta\Delta m)$. This preserves the derivation and your logistic fits.&#x20;
* **Trajectory generator**: Add a *ray mode* (eikonal, curvature $\propto \Theta|\nabla M|$) and a *flow mode* (superfluid velocity update). Use either per task.
* **Tube finder**: Use the folding descent to relax candidate paths into stable tubes; score by $\mathcal F[\gamma]$.

---

## 5) What this buys you (intelligence & efficiency)

* **Correct inductive bias.** Routing and structure formation now follow from an action and two PDEs, not heuristics. This massively cuts the search space and makes behavior predictable (better sample efficiency in any planning/optimization that rides on the runtime).
* **Generalization by scale collapse.** Everything relevant is in $\Theta, D_a, \Lambda, \Gamma$. Your figures already show collapses/logistic fits and a stability band that are *size‑free*; the code will inherit that.&#x20;
* **Mechanistic function.** Folding gives *functional* structures (channels, junctions) that bias flows - the same reason proteins work. Here it’s tubes biasing void flows. That is a principled way to get emergent competence without any “ML tricks”.

**Caveats (straight talk).**

* Full Navier-Stokes with all turbulence features is **not** guaranteed unless you enforce incompressibility and include explicit viscous terms; the complex‑scalar route gives you compressible, potential flows + quantized vortices, which is already a huge step.
* The Voxtrium macro coupling should stay *optional* in the runtime; use it for cosmology‑facing experiments, not for local intelligence loops unless you really want macro bookkeeping in the loop.

## 6) Proof checkpoints you can close this week

1. **Hydro derivation notebook.** Show amplitude-phase variation → continuity + Euler with $c$ matching $2Ja^2$. (One page.)&#x20;
2. **Junction law from softmax.** For a 2‑branch node: $P(A)=\sigma(\Theta\Delta m)$ - literally two lines. (Already reflected by your figure.)&#x20;
3. **Curvature law.** From Fermat with $n=e^{\eta M}$: $\kappa=\eta|\nabla_\perp M|$. (One paragraph derivation; matches your plot.)&#x20;
4. **Tube solver sanity.** Solve the Bessel secular eqn., count $N_{\rm tach}(R)$, condense, and confirm a non‑negative Hessian eigen‑spectrum (Bordag parity). (Credit Voxtrium/Bordag.)
5. **Dissipation ledger → retarded source.** Show units flow into $J^0$ with the kernel’s Θ‑support (one‑cell experiment).

## 7) Attribution

* **Tachyonic tube strategy and macro‑sourcing framing** credit to *Voxtrium* (Bordag’s finite‑radius flux‑tube tachyon condensation adapted to FUM).

### Bottom line

Yes - this is feasible and worth doing. Make the smallest physics‑faithful extension (complex scalar), wire in the proven memory steering, keep a strict dissipation ledger, and let tubes *fold* by minimizing a free energy tied to $M$. That locks your runtime to the parts of the theory that are already strong and falsifiable, and it will make the system sharper, more predictable, and more *efficiently intelligent* - without touching any “ML crap.”

If you want, I’ll draft the exact function signatures and a test harness for (i) junction logistic, (ii) curvature scaling, and (iii) tube folding energy drop, all under the same dimensionless knobs so you can merge in small PRs.
