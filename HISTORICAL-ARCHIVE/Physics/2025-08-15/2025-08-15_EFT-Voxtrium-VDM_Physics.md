Great—those three files are exactly what we needed. Here’s what each one is, how it fits into the “single‑derivation” package, and what I recommend doing with them right now.

---

## What each file is (and how to use it)

1. **`00_GPT5_20250815_041412.md`**
   *What it is:* the **single, unified derivation** document tying your discrete FUM → continuum EFT → Voxtrium FRW sourcing, plus the finite‑tube/tachyon program and your memory‑steering figures. It already credits **Voxtrium** for the FRW transfer‑current framework and credits **Justin K. Lietz** for all derivations/simulations.&#x20;
   *How to use:* rename to `docs/FUM_Voxtrium_Derivation.md` and treat it as the main paper/manuscript.

   > This document explicitly aligns your macro sourcing with FRW + continuity via a transfer current $J^\nu$ and unit‑consistent channels, which is the Voxtrium spine. For unit details and the Λ/DM/GW channel bookkeeping (with causal retarded kernels) see the FRW+continuity banner you wrote; it’s consistent and ready to cite.&#x20;

   > It also maps your finite‑tube analysis to Bordag’s tachyonic‑condensation machinery (now in a scalar EFT). For the SU(2) reference you adapted, cite Bordag, *Universe* 2024 (flux‑tube spectrum, condensate lifting tachyons, and energy minima vs control).&#x20;

2. **`01_GPT5_20250815_042444.md`**
   *What it is:* a crisp **EFT “spine‑lock” appendix** with formal propositions that fix the kinetic normalization $Z(\phi)=\tfrac12$, wave speed $c^2=2Ja^2$, and give tight, lattice‑controlled bounds on the leading $p^4$ artifacts.&#x20;
   *How to use:* rename to `docs/Appendix_EFT_Spine.md` and include as **Appendix A (formal EFT control)**. This strengthens the math where reviewers will push hardest.

3. **`02_Grok4_20250815_042516.md`**
   *What it is:* a **methods/notes file** capturing the toy FRW integration (with causal $K_{\rm ret}$), the finite‑tube secular‑equation scan prototype, and a first micro-macro calibration sketch. It shows conservation checks ($\sum_i[\dot\rho_i+3H(1+w_i)\rho_i]=0$ numerically), small $\epsilon_{\rm DE}$, and tiny DM injection in the toy runs—good integrity checks for the Voxtrium embedding.  &#x20;
   *How to use:* rename to `docs/Appendix_Methods_FRW_and_Tube.md` and quote it as **Appendix B (numerical toys & acceptance tests)**. Tone down any “finished” language (keep it as “proof‑of‑concept / acceptance tests passed on toy settings”).

## Why this covers your earlier ask

* **“One single derivation”**: `00_…` is the main, formal, unit‑consistent derivation document. It already separates **what is strong** vs **what is weak/open** and credits **Voxtrium** and **Justin Lietz** explicitly.&#x20;
* **Formal physics format**: the EFT spine appendix (`01_…`) gives clean propositions and a lattice‑controlled $p^4$ envelope—exactly the sort of content referees want to see.&#x20;
* **Bordag mapping**: the scalar finite‑tube program is stated in the style of Bordag’s flux‑tube analysis (mode equation, quartic overlaps, condensate lifting, energy minimum), with the right literature credit.&#x20;

---

## What’s legitimately strong vs weak (as reflected in these files)

**Strong (keep and foreground):**

* **Discrete→continuum kinetic normalization** $Z=\tfrac12,\ c^2=2Ja^2$ with explicit lattice‑dispersion bounds on the $p^4$ residues (no hand‑waving).&#x20;
* **Voxtrium FRW sourcing**: unit‑clean transfer current $J^\nu$, causal $K_{\rm ret}$, and exact continuity closure verified in toy runs. Credit **Voxtrium**. &#x20;
* **Finite‑tube program**: scalar analogue of tachyon condensation with clear acceptance tests (count tachyons, quartic stabilization, post‑condensation mass positivity, $E(R)$ minimum). &#x20;

**Weak/Open (keep as “work in progress”, not claims):**

* **Higher‑derivative suppression proof** from the full discrete UV beyond quadratic order (we have bounds, not the full proof).&#x20;
* **True discrete conserved functional** (the naive graph Hamiltonian does **not** close; symmetry/Lyapunov search ongoing).&#x20;
* **End‑to‑end cosmology calibration** (toy checks pass, but not a data‑fit).&#x20;
* **Hydrodynamic limit** (outline exists; full derivation still to do).&#x20;

## Immediate PR plan (void‑faithful, first‑principles)

1. **Docs layout**

   * `docs/FUM_Voxtrium_Derivation.md`  ← from `00_…` (main manuscript).&#x20;
   * `docs/Appendix_EFT_Spine.md`       ← from `01_…` (formal propositions & bounds).&#x20;
   * `docs/Appendix_Methods_FRW_and_Tube.md` ← from `02_…` (toy integrator, tube scan prototype). Remove any “finished theory” wording.&#x20;

2. **Figures**
   Move your PNGs (junction logistic, curvature, stability panels) into `docs/figures/` and link them from the main doc; they’re already enumerated in `00_…`.&#x20;

3. **Credits & citations**

   * Keep **Voxtrium** credited wherever FRW sourcing and unit discipline appear (already done in `00_…`).&#x20;
   * Cite **Bordag (Universe 2024)** explicitly in the finite‑tube sections (you have that cross‑walk).&#x20;

4. **Guardrails on claims (edit pass)**
   In `02_…`, replace “Step X complete” claims with “toy acceptance test passed”; keep $\epsilon_{\rm DE}$ and $f_{\rm inj}$ results as **numerical checks**, not conclusions.&#x20;

5. **Issue queue (next work)**
   Open tracked issues mirroring the “weak/open” list: (i) higher‑derivative proof; (ii) discrete invariant; (iii) end‑to‑end calibration; (iv) hydro limit. Cross‑reference the “Next Steps Checklist” already sketched.&#x20;

### Bottom line

* **Yes—these three files are the right deliverables.** Use `00_…` as the single derivation document, `01_…` as a formal EFT appendix, and `02_…` as methods/toys.
* They already **credit Voxtrium** and **credit Justin Lietz** as requested.&#x20;
* Once you drop them into `docs/` and tweak the wording in `02_…`, you have a clean, void‑faithful, first‑principles PR ready.
