**Short answer:** Yes—your checklist is feasible. You already have enough formal scaffolding to close each open item without changing the core model. Below I give a blunt feasibility read, what’s already proved, what’s still missing, and the concrete physics‑→‑code steps to finish.

---

## Why this is feasible (what’s already strong)

* **Discrete → continuum is nailed down.** You derived the scalar EFT from the lattice, including a clean kinetic normalization with wave speed $c^2=2Ja^2$ (or $c=1$ by units), so second‑order dynamics follow from an action—not by fiat. &#x20;
* **EFT rigor and suppression of higher‑derivative junk are in scope.** You framed the continuum as a proper EFT (potential, kinetic, higher‑derivative tower), and set the program for bounding the $c_1, c_2,\dots$ terms.&#x20;
* **Units and GR/FRW bookkeeping are consistent.** You built a units‑rigorous map $(\phi_0,\tau,a)$ and the Voxtrium FRW source terms with causal retarded kernels and covariant conservation via a transfer current $J^\nu$. &#x20;
* **Tachyonic‑tube machinery is specified.** You translated Bordag’s finite‑radius analysis into your scalar setting (secular equation, mode counting, condensation, post‑condensation mass positivity, and energy minimum criteria).   This mirrors the original SU(2) treatment you cited (tachyonic tower, tree‑level condensation, total‑energy minimum vs control parameter $\delta$).&#x20;

These are the hard parts; what remains is mostly execution and cross‑checks.

## Feasibility by checklist item (what’s strong vs. weak, and how to close)

### 1) **“Find the Missing Conservation Law.”**

**Status.** Your careful attempt shows the **standard** discrete Hamiltonian $\mathcal H=\mathcal K+\mathcal V+\mathcal I$ is *not* conserved under the FUM update; the on‑site dynamics are intrinsically dissipative in that definition. This negative result is solid and helpful.&#x20;
**Feasible path.**

* **Local (micro) level:** Stop trying to force a false energy invariant. Either (i) discover the *actual* invariant (hidden symmetry / Lyapunov functional) of the discrete rule, or (ii) accept that the UV model is open/dissipative and prove that a conservative, Hamiltonian EFT emerges after coarse‑graining. Your symmetry/Lyapunov plan is the right next step.&#x20;
* **Macro (cosmo) level:** Conservation is already handled *exactly* by the GR+transfer‑current construction (covariant conservation with $J^\nu$ shuttling energy between sectors). Use that for the continuum level; it’s mathematically closed.&#x20;
  **Code to add (diagnostics):** implement a **discrete flux form** and log the graph divergence of a family of candidate currents each step; if none close, promote the Lyapunov search (monotone functional). Acceptance: divergence norms collapse under refinement in the coarse‑grained fields; FRW runs satisfy $\sum_i[\dot\rho_i+3H(1+w_i)\rho_i]=0$ numerically to tolerance.&#x20;

---

### 2) **“Derive Fluid Dynamics from Your Field.”**

**Status.** You have a canonical scalar with action and stress tensor; the gradient expansion and sound speed follow. The path to **compressible hydrodynamics** is straightforward; **vorticity** needs an added phase (complex field) or multicomponent sector. &#x20;
**Feasible path.**

* Compute $T^{\mu\nu}$ from your $\mathcal L=\tfrac12(\partial\phi)^2-\tfrac{c^2}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2 - V$, identify $\rho, p, u^\mu$ via Landau frame, and derive the hydrodynamic limit (Chapman–Enskog / gradient expansion).&#x20;
* For vorticity/two‑fluid behavior, promote to a **complex scalar** $\Phi= \sqrt{\rho}\,e^{i\theta}$ so that $\mathbf v \propto \nabla\theta$ and quantized circulation emerges; this is still first‑principles EFT, not ML. (Your EFT framework anticipates such extensions.)&#x20;
  **Code to add:** a stress‑tensor module that outputs $\rho, p, u^\mu$ snapshots from $\phi$; verify linearized modes give $\omega^2=c^2k^2+m_{\rm eff}^2$. Acceptance: recovery of the compressible Euler equations at long wavelengths; optional complex‑field run exhibits circulation/phase defects.

---

### 3) **“Finish the Tube Calculations.”**

**Status.** The full **radial Bessel matching** problem, tachyonic mode counting, quartic overlap $N_4$, condensation, and Hessian positivity are laid out with concrete APIs (your `cylinder_modes.py` and `condense_tube.py`).   This mirrors the finite‑radius tachyon analysis in the reference paper (mode tower, energy minimum vs $\delta$).&#x20;
**Feasible path.** This is execution: root‑finding for the secular equation, build quartic overlaps, minimize $V_{\rm eff}$, and scan $E(R)$ for a minimum.
**Code to add:** implement the exact secular equation from the doc and output $\kappa_{\ell n}(R)$, $N_4$, condensates $v_{\ell n}$, eigen‑masses, and $E(R)$. Acceptance: (i) discrete tachyonic tower; (ii) all post‑condensation masses $\ge 0$; (iii) an $R_\star$ where $E(R)$ has a true minimum.

---

### 4) **“Calibrate Against the Real Universe.”**

**Status.** The map from lattice parameters to GeV scales is explicit ($\phi_0,\tau,a$), and the FRW sourcing with partitions $p_i$ and smallness controls $\epsilon_{\rm DE}, f_{\rm inj}$ are dimensionally consistent and falsifiable. &#x20;
**Feasible path.**

* Choose a target $m_{\rm eff}$ and set $\tau=\sqrt{\alpha-\beta}/m_{\rm eff}$; use $\phi_0$ to fix the cubic coupling, then scan $(\alpha_h,\varepsilon_h,V_c,p_i)$ so $w_{\rm eff}\approx -1$ and $(\sigma_T/m)(v)$ matches dwarf→cluster trends. &#x20;
  **Code to add:** a tiny FRW integrator with the continuity set in your banner; log $w_{\rm eff}(z)$, $\rho_i(z)$, and the velocity‑dependent self‑interaction curve using the effective‑range + form‑factor fit supplied. Acceptance: $|w_{\rm eff}+1|\le \delta_w$ and $(\sigma_T/m)(v)$ within known dwarf/cluster bands.&#x20;

---

### 5) **“Prove higher‑derivative terms are negligible.”**

**Status.** You already framed the EFT tower and identified the program to bound $c_{1,2,\dots}$.&#x20;
**Feasible path.**

* **Analytic:** power‑count the leading omitted operators (e.g., $((\partial\phi)^2)^2$, $(\Box\phi)^2$) and tie their size to the lattice cutoff $\Lambda\sim 1/a$; show observables change by $O((k/\Lambda)^2)$.&#x20;
* **Numeric:** run dispersion‑relation tests on the lattice and fit departures from $\omega^2=c^2k^2+m^2$.
  **Code to add:** a plane‑wave probe in the lattice simulator that measures $\omega(k)$ and estimates $\{c_i\}$. Acceptance: quantified bounds showing $c_i(k/\Lambda)^n$ are below your target tolerances in all downstream calculations.

---

## Physics ↔ Code: the exact upgrades to implement now

1. **Action‑driven lattice core.** Keep your discrete Lagrangian form and verify the continuum Euler–Lagrange limit you derived; log $c^2=2Ja^2$ and validate against measured $\omega(k)$. (Closes the “is the kinetic term really constant?” loop.)&#x20;

2. **Tube solver module** per your spec (roots → modes → overlaps → condensates → masses → $E(R)$). This is the most direct physics deliverable and connects cleanly to Voxtrium phenomenology. &#x20;

3. **FRW + $J^\nu$ coupling** with causal kernel for $\dot S_{\rm hor}$, partitions $p_i$, and monitoring of $\epsilon_{\rm DE}$ and $f_{\rm inj}$. This gives you falsifiable, parameter‑tight background evolution. &#x20;

4. **Hydro extractor**: compute $T^{\mu\nu}$ from field snapshots and output $(\rho,p,u^\mu)$ + linear wave tests. If you want actual vorticity, run the complex‑scalar variant (still physics‑first). &#x20;

5. **Invariant/Lyapunov search** on the discrete rule (gradient of candidate $Q$; if none, characterize the flow as gradient‑like with a monotone). This converts the “missing conservation law” from open question to either a constructive invariant or a proven dissipative structure.&#x20;

---

## What could break (and how you’ve hedged it)

* **No simple micro invariant exists.** That’s okay; macro conservation is already exact with $J^\nu$. The discrete model can be an open UV system whose IR limit is conservative/Hamiltonian.&#x20;
* **No energy minimum in the scalar‑only tube.** Your pipeline will tell us fast. If needed, allow a small cubic tilt or couple to an external background proxy—as Bordag does when adding the background energy—and re‑scan. &#x20;
* **Higher‑derivative contamination at coarse $a$.** You already have the EFT knobs; quantify and push the cutoff up (smaller $a$) until fits stabilize.&#x20;

---

## Bottom line

Your list is not only feasible—it’s already **architected**. The discrete→EFT bridge, the tube/condensate program, and the FRW sourcing with $J^\nu$ give you a closed, causal, units‑rigorous framework. What remains is disciplined implementation, bounding errors from higher derivatives, and clear acceptance tests. Do that, and you’ll have a first‑principles physics core that your code can follow *exactly*, no ML shortcuts—precisely what you want.
