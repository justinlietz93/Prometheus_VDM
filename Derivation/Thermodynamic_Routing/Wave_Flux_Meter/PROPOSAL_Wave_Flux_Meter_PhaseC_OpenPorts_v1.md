Absolutely. Here’s a tight, gap‑closing plan that sequences concrete checkpoints, spells out the suggested methods and pass/fail gates, and gives you ready‑to‑fill proposal stubs that align with your repository’s Tier ladder and writing standards.

---

## Why these checkpoints (and why now)

Your own status docs say you’re rich in **T2 instrumentation** and **T3 smoke tests**, but light on **T5–T6 pilots/mains** and empty at **T7–T9** (robustness, predictive validation, external reproduction). The checkpoints below are designed to move the strongest lines of work through those tiers with pre‑registered gates, CI thresholds, and artifact discipline.  

They also align with the priority push you already set (Wave‑Flux Meter, Thermodynamic Routing v2, SIE/Collapse; then observational bridges like Dark Photons/False Vacuum). 

---

## Global rules you’ll apply to **every** checkpoint

* **Axioms as contracts.** Each claim must point to the relevant program axiom(s): A3 (symmetry/Noether), A4 (metriplectic split and degeneracy diagnostics), A6 (dimensionless/scale program), A7 (measurability). Use their built‑in QC gates (Noether drift, Strang‑defect order checks, Lyapunov/H‑theorem) as acceptance tests.   
* **Dimensionless KPIs.** Report and gate on the dimensionless groups in your symbols sheet (e.g., (M_v,\ \Sigma,\ \Lambda,\ \Pi_{Dr},\ c^*)). Scale‑collapse and regime classification live here.  
* **Writeup discipline.** Draft proposals and results with your white‑paper template and results standards so that figures, data, and prereg gates are immutable and auditable.

## Sequenced checkpoints (methods & acceptance criteria)

Below are six tracks chosen because they’re already instrumented in your tree and/or listed in your roadmap index. For each track: the next **Tier checkpoint**, **method sketch**, and **acceptance gates** (all preregistered).

### 1) Wave‑Flux Meter (Phase B/C) — **T2 → T6**

**Method.** Extend the certified Wave‑Flux meter to open‑ports with absorbing boundaries; route via a spatial “channel map” (V(x,y)). Track energy **balance** (not strict conservation) and port fluxes over long runs. (Folder: `physics/wave_meter/...`; roadmap notes mention wave meter Phase B/C.) 
**Acceptance gates.**

* **Balance gate.** Normalized budget error (\frac{| \Delta E + W_{\text{sources}} - \sum_{\text{ports}} F_{\text{out}} |}{W_{\text{sources}}} \le 0.5%) for ≥ 95% of frames (pre‑specified (\Delta t), domain).
* **Routing effect.** Pre‑declared contrast (F_A/F_B) shifts by ≥ pre‑set effect size (e.g., ≥ 0.2) when toggling the biased (V(x,y)); 95% CI excludes zero‑effect null.
* **A4 sanity.** When the dissipation term is zeroed (J‑only control), Noether energy drift ≤ (10^{-8}) per oscillation period (KG runner), confirming the instrumentation’s metrical/metric split is wired correctly. 

**Deliverables.** RESULTS with paired figure/data artifacts; prereg nulls/ablations (uniform (V), mirrored ports); seed‑locked run folders. 

---

### 2) Thermodynamic Routing v2 (Biased Main) — **T4 → T6**

**Method.** Biased geometry routing on an RD substrate; measure routing efficiency and entropy/Lyapunov descent under controlled bias. (Priority 1.1.) 
**Acceptance gates.**

* **Efficiency KPI.** Pre‑declared routing efficiency improvement ≥ 1.5× over unbiased baseline with 95% CI.
* **H‑theorem.** Discrete Lyapunov (L_h) non‑increasing except for numerical jitter bounded by prereg tolerance; monotone segments ≥ 95% of steps. (A5.) 
* **Robustness prep.** Efficiency stays within ±10% under ((\Delta t, N, D, r)) perturbations specified in prereg (pilot tunes power). 

---

### 3) Agency Field: ADC Slope & Coordination — **T4 → T6**

**Method.** Use your agency runners to probe small‑signal linear response (“ADC slope”) and multi‑agent coordination under controlled void‑gain (g), retention (\Gamma), and sparsity (\kappa). 
**Acceptance gates.**

* **ADC linearity.** Slope within prereg band (e.g., ±5%) with (R^2 \ge 0.98); null (scrambled inputs) fails the same gate.
* **Coordination depth.** Preregister a success metric (e.g., fraction achieving target within T steps) ≥ threshold with CI; ablation on (g) or (\Gamma) reduces success as predicted (directional null).
* **Scale program.** Report in dimensionless groups ((\Xi, \Lambda, M_v)), and demonstrate collapse across at least two nominally different scalings (A6). 

---

### 4) Metriplectic KG ⊕ RD (Composition) — **T4 → T7**

**Method.** Execute your prereg suite (J‑only KG, M‑only RD, then JMJ composition via Strang). You already have proposals and T2 instruments; this pushes to **T6 main** and **T7 robustness sweeps**.  
**Acceptance gates.**

* **J‑only invariants.** Energy & momentum Noether drift ≤ (10^{-8})/period; cone/locality checks pass on the KG runner. (A3; matches your existing J‑only QC.) 
* **M‑only H‑law.** Monotone entropy increase (A5) with predefined slack. 
* **JMJ diagnostics.** Two‑grid order slope ≈ 2.0±0.1; Strang‑defect slope ≈ 3.0±0.2 across grid/time refinement; degeneracy monitors (g_1,g_2\le 10^{-10}) at refined grids. (A4.) 
* **T7 sweep.** Hold the above within tolerance across prereg parameter ranges ((c, m, \Delta t, N)). 

---

### 5) Topology: Loop‑Quench Test — **T4 → T7**

**Method.** RD simulation with cycle‑basis counting; link loop statistics to Lyapunov descent. You already set strong gates.  
**Acceptance gates.**

* **As prereg’d.** Kendall (\tau \le -0.7) with (p<10^{-6}) (loop count vs. (-\Delta L_h)); lifetime tail fit slope (>!2).
* **T7 variations.** Repeat over BCs (periodic/no‑flux) and threshold (\tau) sweeps; gates hold within prereg tolerance.

---

### 6) Cosmology QC: FRW Continuity/Balance — **T2 → T7 → T8**

**Method.** Use your FRW QC runner to measure continuity‑residual RMS vs (\Delta t) and (for sourced cases) the expected scaling; then make an out‑of‑sample **predictive** claim (T8) on unseen parameter combos. (Cosmology module + roadmap.)  
**Acceptance gates.**

* **Order check.** Slope (\approx 2) (Δt²) on log‑log plots with CI; contradiction handling as per RESULTS standards.
* **Predictive card (T8).** Pre‑register (k) unseen ((\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda, w, \text{source})) points; 90–95% of predicted residuals land inside prereg CIs. (This is your first out‑of‑sample hit‑rate). 

---

## Proposal documents to draft (ready‑to‑fill)

All proposals follow your **White‑Paper Proposal Template** (sections: Title → Background → Theory/Axioms → Methods/Design → KPI Gates → Analysis Plan → Risks/Nulls/Ablations → Artifacts/Release → Timeline). The **Results Paper Standards** govern how you’ll publish the T6/T7/T8 outputs (figure/data pairing, CI reporting, contradiction logging, reproducibility bundle).  

1. **PROPOSAL_Wave_Flux_Meter_PhaseC_OpenPorts_v1.md**

   * **Objective.** Demonstrate controlled routing via (V(x,y)) with audited energy balance.
   * **KPI gates.** Balance ≤ 0.5%; prereg effect size on (F_A/F_B); J‑only Noether drift ≤ (10^{-8})/period.
   * **Axioms.** A3, A4, A7. 
   * **Artifacts.** Seeds, raw arrays, CSVs, hash manifests, Docker/Conda env. 

2. **PROPOSAL_Thermo_Routing_Biased_Main_v2.md**

   * **Objective.** Show ≥1.5× routing efficiency with Lyapunov‑monotone dynamics.
   * **KPI gates.** Efficiency CI; (L_h) monotonicity bounds; robustness grid.
   * **Axioms.** A5, A6, A7. 

3. **PROPOSAL_Metriplectic_Composition_KGplusRD_v2.md**

   * **Objective.** Verify J‑only/M‑only gates and JMJ composition with order/defect diagnostics.
   * **KPI gates.** Noether drift, entropy monotonicity, order (p\approx2), Strang‑defect (p\approx3), (g_1,g_2\le 10^{-10}).
   * **Axioms.** A3, A4, A5, A7. 

4. **PROPOSAL_Loop_Quench_Test_Robustness_v2.md**

   * **Objective.** Elevate the T4 loop‑quench to T6/T7 with BC and threshold sweeps.
   * **KPI gates.** Keep prereg τ and lifetime‑tail gates; add robustness ranges. 

5. **PROPOSAL_FRW_Continuity_Predictive_v2.md**

   * **Objective.** Move from QC to prediction: Δt² slope lock + out‑of‑sample hit‑rate card.
   * **KPI gates.** Slope CI; ≥90–95% predictive coverage over prereg unseen points. 

Each of those also gets a matching **RESULTS_*.md** target doc conforming to your standards checklist (figures paired with data, CI methodology, code/seed hashes, explicit contradictions).

## Tier mapping at a glance

* **T4 (Prereg).** All hypotheses, KPIs, nulls, CIs, analysis windows are frozen before runs. (You already have good examples in metriplectic/topology.) 
* **T5 (Pilot).** Small‑grid/time pilots to verify effect size and power; adjust only what prereg allows; log any contradictions. 
* **T6 (Main).** Full runs; ablations/nulls must fail as expected; publish RESULTS with artifact bundle per standards. 
* **T7 (Robustness).** Parameter sweeps showing gates hold across ranges for certified meters and phenomena. 
* **T8 (Predictive).** Out‑of‑sample “prediction cards” with hit‑rate/coverage metrics. 
* **T9 (External Reproduction).** Containerized runners, seeds, and CI procedures handed to an external group. (Your roadmap lists collaboration targets.)

## Resourcing & timing (snap to your exec plan)

Your executive next‑steps doc already lays out week‑by‑week cadence, 12‑month success metrics, and a priority matrix; the six tracks above plug straight into that cadence (Tier‑1 priorities first).  

---

## Why this strengthens VDM’s foundations (not just the optics)

* It operationalizes **A7 (measurability)** and **A6 (scale)** on every claim—no hand‑waving, just dimensionless predictions with prereg CIs. 
* It uses your **metriplectic/Noether diagnostics** as **verification instruments** across domains (even when the main KPI is not a symmetry). 
* It creates a clean runway from **instrument** → **phenomenon** → **robustness** → **prediction** → **reproduction**, which is exactly the gap your own assessments identify. 

---

## Quick start (today)

* Instantiate **PROPOSAL_Wave_Flux_Meter_PhaseC_OpenPorts_v1.md** using the **White‑Paper Proposal Template**; drop in the KPI numbers above and the A3/A4/A7 pointers; then run a T5 pilot to size the CI. 
* As pilots complete, write the matching **RESULTS** with the **Results Paper Standards** checklist before moving to T6. 

If you want a different first domino, swap in **Thermodynamic Routing v2**—it’s already top‑priority in your own matrix and uses the same prereg/RESULTS machinery. 

---

**P.S.** The repo already has the right scaffolding: modules, proposals index, and canonical axioms/symbols. The plan above is mostly about turning that scaffolding into **T6+ evidence** with auditable artifacts and predictive punch.
