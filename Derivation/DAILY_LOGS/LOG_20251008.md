## Code helper updates

I've been reorganizing the common/ folder to enforce my approvals before letting the physicist agent run experiments. The process goes like this:

**1. Organization**
The agent creates a {domain}/ folder under Prometheus_VDM/Derivation

**2. Discipline**
The agent creates a proposal file following the exact proposal document template and places it under the domain folder just created.

**3. Code**
Once the proposal and plan is accepted and understood, the agent creates experiment scripts under Prometheus_VDM/Derivation/code/physics/{domain}

**4. Engineering Standards**
These scripts must use the shared helpers from code/common/ like the io_paths.py, plotting/, data/, constants/, authorization/ and vdm_equations.py helpers.

**5. Authorization**
In order to run these experiments a tagged schema file must be created in the code/physics/{domain} folder with the required shape and keys. This must contain the authorization hash key in order for the experiment scripts to run. This is to prevent the agent from prematurely running experiments before we've created a proposal document with our predictions.

**6. Data**
There will be an authorization database that contains the hashed keys based on either the domain + script file name + tag + approval key; this works on any tag in a given experiment script in the domain folder, or the domain + script file name + tag + approval secret *only works on a per run basis, works for one unique tag*. The approval secret takes priority over the approval key, if no approval secret is set then the approval key is checked against the hash in the json file. If the key doesnt match the experiment script isn't run and explains exactly why. (incorrect key / secret, etc.)

**7. Logging**
Experiments will now insert the run logs into a database, the database name is the {domain} folders name, the tables are named by the experiment name, and the data is tracked by tag + batch number which is incremental.

**8. Trust**
Each row must include the timestamp (date + time) that it was logged at, as well as a hash for the entire row to stamp the record in time and improve trust

**9. Artifacts**
Every experiment must use the io_paths helper to manage run artifacts, this helper also includes enforcement checks to make sure the run has been approved and that a proposal file has been created.
