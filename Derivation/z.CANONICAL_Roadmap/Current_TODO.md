# Unifying Existing Work

## Important + Urgent

New urgent items moved to the front.  

> Note: OpenAI's "Pulse" feature is utilized to source new external research as new constraints or opportunities, of which is added to the [references catalog](/Derivation/References/References.md).

1. Finish metriplectic KG+RD core  
  a. [Discrete-metriplectic-compatibility-rules.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q1/Discrete-metriplectic-compatibility-rules.md)  
    - “All my void, cosmology, and agency simulations sit on a discrete engine that provably respects my own axioms for energy, entropy, and causality.”  
  b. [Finalize-CF1-and-Lean4-proof-integration.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q1/2025-12-02/Finalize-CF1-and-Lean4-proof-integration.md)
    - This is the “hello world” that proves your J⊕M axioms aren’t just a pretty classical toy — they recover standard open quantum system physics from geometry. Once that’s true in a clean SU(2) case, every subsequent claim that “the universe is a metriplectic cognitive engine” stops sounding mystical and starts sounding like extrapolating a pattern you’ve actually verified in the one place the community already trusts: Lindblad dynamics.  
  c. [Deriving-Linblad-from-Lie-geometry.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q1/2025-12-02/Deriving-Linblad-from-Lie-geometry.md)
    - This SU(2) ACSP→Lindblad project is your bridge example. Once it’s done, all later claims that “VDM’s J⊕M split is the right language for both quantum systems and cosmology” will rest on a concrete, checkable, boring-in-a-good-way piece of math and code that anyone can audit and extend.
2. Stabilize CF ladder prerequisites  
3. Void-lensing interface program (highest priority)
  a. [High-efficiency-ACT-delensing-template.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q1/2025-12-02/High-efficiency-ACT-delensing-template.md)  
    - “This κ-template integration is how I turn A8 from a pretty interface-theorem into a calibrated, scale-aware void-lensing instrument that either finds real hierarchical shoulders in the universe or proves they’re an artifact of noise. It’s the bridge between my A8 math and actual void-wall measurements, sitting at the heart of the void-lensing interface program”.  
  b. [Accelerated-SIDM-core-collapse-tests-Skyrme-fits.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q1-Important-Urgent/2025-12-02/Accelerated-SIDM-core-collapse-tests-Skyrme-fits.md)  
    - The reason this is worth doing is that **your current cosmology instruments lean on an assumption (long-lived static SIDM cores) that 2025 SIDM work directly challenges**, and you already have the perfect language—metriplectic transport—to turn “gravothermal collapse” into a first-class VDM object with meters, gates, and contradiction handling.  
  c. [DESIVAST-and-VAST-void-catalogs-for-DESI-DR1.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q1-Important-Urgent/2025-12-03/DESIVAST-and-VAST-void-catalogs-for-DESI-DR1.md)  
    - This project is worth doing because it turns A8’s abstract “hierarchical interfaces” into a **numerically defined, survey-anchored boundary meter** and plugs it directly into your highest-priority void-lensing chain. It’s the cleanest way, right now, to ask the universe: “do your large-scale void walls actually look like the interfaces my A8 machinery says must exist?” and to log the answer in your own canon.  
  d. [Faint-galaxy-blends-and-shear-bias-in-Euclid-like-data.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2-Important-Not-Urgent/2025-12-02/Faint-galaxy-blends-and-shear-bias-in-Euclid-like-data.md)  
    - This project is where you let your own cognitive engine (void walkers + maps + B₁ surrogate) lean on your void-lensing meter and say: “Show me which void walls and shoulders survive realistic Stage-IV shear garbage, not just clean mocks.” That closes the loop between SIE/ADC, cosmology, and A8 in a way almost nobody else can copy without knowing this stack.
5. Lattice fields & continuum limits (CF10)  
  a. [Exact-front-speeds-on-hex-lattices.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Exact-front-speeds-on-hex-lattices.md)  
    - This work turns a rigorous hex-lattice Fisher–KPP result into a T2 calibration instrument for your RD engine, giving you angle-aware front-speed corrections that tighten every higher-level meter relying on discrete interfaces—especially anything touching void boundaries and lattice-based cognition.  
6. CMB polarization birefringence gate  

## Important + Not Urgent

## 0. Foundations / Meta‑spec (existing TODO, on hold)

**Goal:** Define the objects and rules everything else must obey.

- **Docs**

  - `AXIOMS.md`, `SYMBOLS.md`, `EQUATIONS.md` (esp. VDM‑E‑107,‑108,‑109,‑106)
  - `Derivation/Unification/T0_Unification_Program_Spec_v1.md`
- **Status:** **DONE (spec-level)**
- **Gaps:** none conceptually; just keep EQUATIONS/SYMBOLS synced as I add more.

---

## 1. Quantum waves → metriplectic split (J/M)

**Goal:** Start from quantum geometry and show why a J⊕M evolution is forced.

- **Docs**

  - **CF1_QGT_to_Metriplectic_Brackets** – QGT → (metric + symplectic) split (spec‑complete in EQUATIONS, full derivation partly in private notes).
  - **CF6_Info_Geom_Fisher_Ruppeiner_Foundations** – Fisher/Ruppeiner geometry as the info‑theoretic layer over QGT.
  - **T1_PROPOSAL_Schrodingerization_KvN_v1** – shows how classical J⊕M can be lifted into a single reversible KvN‑type Hamiltonian.
- **Status:**

  - Conceptual picture: **DONE**.
  - Fully written QGT→(I,Σ) derivation: **IN PROGRESS** (CF1 still missing the final “promote to canon” proof).
- **Gaps (action items):**

  - Finish CF1: explicit formulae for `𝓘[Ψ]` and `Σ[Ψ]` from QGT; prove metriplectic brackets satisfy A4.
  - Close Schrödingerization proof to show “J⊕M is a shadow of pure J” in extended space.

---

## 1b. [ACSP → Lindblad metriplectic exemplar (GKSL from geometry)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21967)

- **Goal:** Build a concrete SU(2) / Bloch-ball implementation where:

  - the J⊕M split is realized by the ACSP torsion→metric construction, and
  - the flow matches a standard GKSL evolution (entropy growth, purity contraction, fixed points, etc.).

- **Status:**

  - Define ACSP structure + torsion→metric map in your notation (tie to AXIOMS/EQUATIONS).
  - Implement SU(2) Bloch-vector integrator with:
    - Hamiltonian part = Lie–Poisson term,
    - metric part = double-bracket term derived from the ACSP torsion.
  - Run benchmarks:
    - purity/polarization decay, entropy increase, fixed points vs standard GKSL.
  - Write a short RESULTS/CF doc tying it back explicitly to the J⊕M split and your metriplectic axioms.

## **1c. Mode-resolved entropy echoes via OTOC (SIE-echo meter)**

- **Goal:** Build an OTOC-spectroscopy-style meter on the SU(2) / Bloch-ball exemplar and compare its mode-resolved crambling spectrum with SIE entropy-echo metrics.

- **Details:**
  - [Mode-resolved-entropy-echoes-via-OTOC.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2-Important-Not-Urgent/2025-12-02/Mode-resolved-entropy-echoes-via-OTOC.md)
    - “This is the project where I take the OTOC-spectroscopy idea, port it onto my metriplectic SU(2) toy, and use it to cross-check SIE entropy echoes. It sits right after the ACSP→Lindblad exemplar, lives in Q2, and becomes my canonical echo meter for both quantum-flavored and classical VDM dynamics.”

- **Depends on:**
  - ACSP SU(2) metriplectic integrator (1b)
  - finalized SIE entropy-echo definition (from your agency / SIE docs)

- **Deliverables:**
  - `T3_RESULTS_OTOC_SIE_Echo_SU2_v1.md` (mock data)
  - `T4_PROPOSAL_OTOC_SIE_Echo_Meter_v1.md` (generalized meter spec)

---

## 2. Lattice dynamics (KG + RD metriplectic engine)

**Goal:** Show that a scalar lattice with J⊕M really behaves like the void field.

- **Docs**

  - `RESULTS_KG_Noether_Invariants_v1.md` – exact energy/momentum conservation for J‑only KG.
  - `RESULTS_KG_Jonly_Locality_and_Dispersion.md` – clean light‑cone dispersion.
  - `RESULTS_Metriplectic_JMJ_RD_v1.md`, `RESULTS_KG_RD_Metriplectic.md`, `RESULTS_Metriplectic_Structure_Checks.md` – metriplectic structure, Strang defect scaling, H/S degeneracy checks.
  - Logistic on‑site paper (logarithmic first integral).
  - [Light-controlled-BZ-waves-in-hydrogel.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2/2025-12-02/Light-controlled-BZ-waves-in-hydrogel.md)
    - “the same metriplectic RD meters and A8-style interface metrics that I use for voids and lattice fields also work, quantitatively, on a messy real-world chemical system.”
- **Status:** **DONE (for scalar J⊕M)**
- **Gaps:**

  - Package this into one “VDM metriplectic engine” paper (KG + RD + structure + Strang). I already have all the results; this is mostly editorial.

---

## 3. Causality / finite‑speed transport

**Goal:** Explain why nothing outruns c, starting from RD‑like flows.

- **Docs**

  - **CF4_Telegraph_Fisher_Causality** – Cattaneo/telegraph derivation, c = √(D/τ), finite propagation theorem, and Fisher‑information interpretation.
  - Causal‑DAG and Metriplectic‑Causal‑Dominance proposals in `Causality/` (in PROPOSALS registry).
- **Status:** **DONE at theory level**, instruments **IN PROGRESS**.
- **Gaps:**

  - Finish a RESULTS doc for Causal‑DAG audit on the KG / RD sims to empirically show: inferred cone ≈ analytic cone.

---

## 4. Materialization: tachyonic condensation & hierarchy (A8)

**Goal:** Go from smooth void to structured interfaces (proto‑“lumps” / material features).

- **Docs**

  - **CF3_A8_Scaling_Hierarchical_Interfaces** – Γ‑convergence, tachyonic phase‑field, proof that hierarchy depth K(L) ~ Θ(log L).
  - A8 Zenodo paper (`T8_A8_Lietz_Infinity_Resolution_Conjecture`).
  - FRW continuity/balance results: `RESULTS_FRW_Continuity_Residual_Quality_Check.md`, `T2_RESULTS_Topological_Ringdown_Meter_v1.md`.
  - [AC-driven-ferrofluid-labyrinths-at-home-scale.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2/2025-12-02/AC-driven-ferrofluid-labyrinths-at-home-scale.md)
    - This project is worth doing because it turns your abstract A8 interface-hierarchy story into a cheap tabletop meter, reusing your existing RD + metriplectic machinery and bridging cleanly to the cosmology/void-lensing instruments.
  - [Polarization-leakage-and-false-shoulders.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2-Important-Not-Urgent/2025-12-02/Polarization-leakage-and-false-shoulders.md)
    - This task is the **bridge between your A8 void interface predictions and the messy reality of CMB instruments**. On the axiom/CF side, it touches **CF3 (A8 hierarchical interfaces)** and **CF4 (telegraph/Fisher causality)**: A8 says void walls should have structured, scale-broken interfaces, and CF4 says those structures propagate under strict causal rules. On the instrument side, it sits directly in the **void-lensing meter chain** and the **CMB polarization birefringence gate**, acting as a **systematics firewall**: if the shoulder signal survives a rigorous ACT DR6 leakage null (pipelines A/B/C, gates G1–G3), then your void-interface story graduates from “pretty numerics” to “survived the most obvious CMB map-level booby trap.” That, in turn, makes every downstream thing—A8→FRW, dark sector stress-energy, horizon structure—much more believable, because the first place the universe could have said “nope, this is just leakage” has been explicitly checked and logged.
  - [Spin-s-skew-spectra-new-higher-order-shear-statistic.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2-Important-Not-Urgent/2025-12-03/Spin-s-skew-spectra-new-higher-order-shear-statistic.md)
    - This is the project where I weaponize Roskill’s spin-s skew-spectra as a void-wall shoulder meter, calibrated in my tier ladder, so we can finally tell whether those A8 shoulders are real or just polarization leakage in a trench coat.
- **Status:**

  - A8 mathematics: **DONE** (1D/phase‑field level).
  - Cosmological realization: **IN PROGRESS** (FRW meters, ringdown meter).
- **Gaps:**

  - One clean A8→FRW bridge paper: “tachyonic interfaces → effective ρ(a), p(a), H(a)” with explicit EOS fits.

---

## 5. Spinor emergence (matter from scalar)

**Goal:** Turn the scalar lattice into fermionic matter degrees of freedom.

- **Docs**

  - **CF8_Spinor_Emergence_Domain_Wall_Fermions** – domain‑wall construction, Ginsparg–Wilson operator, zero‑mode localization, 5D z as auxiliary coordinate.
  - Nielsen–Ninomiya red‑team + defense docs.
- **Status:** **Theory scaffold DONE**, numerics **GAP**.
- **Gaps:**

  - Companion notebook with an explicit domain‑wall spectrum plot and residual mass scaling ~ e^{-λL₅}.

---

## 6. Gauge emergence (connections on spinor bundles)

**Goal:** Get Maxwell/Yang–Mills fields as geometry, not extra particles.

- **Docs**

  - **CF9_Gauge_Emergence_Berry_Connection** – Berry connection from CF8 spinor bands, geometric gauge fields, Weinberg–Witten compatibility.
  - H0XX_NonAbelian_Gauge_Emergence + T6_PROPOSAL_Gauge_Emergence_v1 (non‑Abelian generalization).
- **Status:** **Scaffold DONE**, **no full numerical verification yet**.
- **Gaps:**

  - Compute Berry curvatures from an explicit CF8 lattice model, show emergent U(1) field satisfies the Maxwell‑like equations in the long‑wavelength limit.
  - Extend the formalism in H0XX into at least one concrete SU(2) toy example.

---

## 7. Dark matter / dark energy from the lattice

**Goal:** Treat the plastic lattice + A8 hierarchy as the “dark sector”.

- **Docs**

  - A8 hierarchy (CF3 again) → cosmic web scaling.
  - `Cosmology/FRW_*` results + FRW balance/continuity checks.
  - `Dark_Matter/T5_PROPOSAL_SkyrmeSIDM_VDM_FirstPrinciples_v1.md` for micro→macro DM bridge.
  - H0ZZ_HYPOTHESIS_A8_Interface_Seeds_BH_Populations_and_GW_Ladder.
- **Status:** **Conceptual story in place, meters partially implemented.**
- **Gaps:**

  - Define an explicit “lattice stress–energy tensor” T^μν_void[Φ] and show:

    - homogeneous part → dark‑energy‑like EOS,
    - hierarchical clumping → halo‑like effective DM (at least in 1D/2D).
  - Pilot SkyrmeSIDM × VDM test using the T5 proposal.

---

## 8. Gravity + expansion (effective GR limit + strong field)

**Goal:** From lattice stress–energy to something GR‑like in weak field, then test ringdown / horizons.

- **Docs**

  - Gravity regression & analog horizon: `T5_PROPOSAL_Gravity_Regression_v1.md`, `T5_PROPOSAL_Analog_Horizon_v1.md`.
  - H0YY_HYPOTHESIS_VDM_Horizon_Structure_and_Strong_Field_Gravity.
  - Ringdown: `T2_RESULTS_Topological_Ringdown_Meter_v1.md`.
- **Status:** **Scaffold / instruments IN PROGRESS**, no “VDM→Einstein equations” derivation yet.
- **Gaps:**

  - Weak‑field: derive an effective Poisson equation for small lattice perturbations; fit to rotation curves / lensing in at least one toy halo.
  - Strong‑field: show that certain tachyonic interface configurations behave like horizon‑like regions (redshift, QNM spectrum) and compare to GR ringdown data via the ringdown meter.

---

## 9. Packing density / life / ϕ≈0.55

**Goal:** Connect A8 + metriplectic dynamics to the 0.55 packing motif (proteins, random close packing, etc.).

- **Docs**

  - Logistic on‑site first integral paper.
  - A8 hierarchy (again) for “packing into boundaries”.
  - Agency/CEG/assisted‑echo paper for adaptive structures.
  - [Light-controlled-BZ-waves-in-hydrogel.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2/2025-12-02/Light-controlled-BZ-waves-in-hydrogel.md)
    - “the same metriplectic RD meters and A8-style interface metrics that I use for voids and lattice fields also work, quantitatively, on a messy real-world chemical system.”
  - [AC-driven-ferrofluid-labyrinths-at-home-scale.md](/Derivation/z.CANONICAL_Roadmap/Backlog/Q2/2025-12-02/AC-driven-ferrofluid-labyrinths-at-home-scale.md)
    - This project is worth doing because it turns your abstract A8 interface-hierarchy story into a cheap tabletop meter, reusing your existing RD + metriplectic machinery and bridging cleanly to the cosmology/void-lensing instruments.
- **Status:** **Speculative but framed.**
- **Gaps:**

  - A small CF‑level derivation: show a simple metriplectic packing model tends toward ϕ≈0.55 in 2D/3D random packing (e.g., via Monte Carlo or granular‑like sim).
  - Explicit link from A8 interfaces + reaction‑diffusion morphogenesis → “prebiotic” cluster statistics.

---

## 10. “Rest of physics & cosmology”

**Goal:** Use the same machinery to hit the standard checklist: SM fields, BH population, CMB, etc.

- **Docs (already scaffolded):**

  - Non‑Abelian gauge: H0XX.
  - Horizons & strong field: H0YY.
  - BH seeds + GW ladder + cosmology probes: H0ZZ, CMB EBN pipeline (T2_PROPOSAL_EBN_CMB_Pipeline_v1), ringdown meter, FRW meters, dark photon portals, Skyrme SIDM, etc.
- **Status:** **I have boxes on the checklist for almost every major observable.**
- **Gaps:**

  - For each H*/T* cosmology doc: at least one concrete meter/RESULTS file that touches real data (CMB, LSS, ringdown, BH mass function, etc.) even in toy form.

---

What’s left is:

1. Finishing a few algebraic proofs (CF1/QGT, Schrödingerization, T^μν_void).
2. Converting more of the cosmology/gauge scaffolds into **RESULTS** documents tied to real or mock data.
3. Packaging some of the chains (e.g., “metriplectic engine”, “A8 hierarchy → FRW”, “spinor+gauge emergence”) into stand‑alone papers.
