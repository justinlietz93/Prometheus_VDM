<!-- ATTENTION! The proposal documents you create MUST BE whitepaper-grade documents with full structure, full narrative, MathJax-rendered equations (Meaning use Github MathJax syntax, $ ... $ and $$ ... $$ instead of other syntax), numeric figure captions tied to actual artifacts if using any for background, explicit thresholds with pass/fail gates, and provenance. You need to imagine if the document will be getting submitted for proposal at the most highly respected and quality Physics journals on Earth. -->
# White Paper Proposal Template

It is MANDATORY and IMPORTANT to include the substance of the outlined topics. The
length of the proposal should not exceed five U.S. letter-sized pages (including figures and references).

> {git rev-parse HEAD} and put the latest commit here for provenance.
> Additionally, reate a hash salted with the commit and put it here.

<!-- This MUST included the grade of proposal this is. The grade of the proposal should be the same as the grade of the RESULTS_* if the runs pass.

Shown in a table below is the T0–T9 maturity ladder. This ladder distinguishes between:

- **Meters/instruments** (T2): Proven testing measurement apparatus
- **Phenomena** (T3+): Making physics claims with those proven meters
- **Preregistered claims** (T4-T6): Formal hypothesis testing
- **Robustness & validation** (T7-T8): Out-of-sample prediction
- **Reproduction** (T9): External verification

Tier Grades

- **T0 (Concept)**
- **T1 (Proto-model)**
- **T2 (Instrument)**
- **T3 (Smoke)**
- **T4 (Prereg)**
- **T5 (Pilot)**
- **T6 (Main Result)**
- **T7 (Out-of-sample prediction)**
- **T8 (Robustness validation and parameter sweeps**
- **T9 (External verification/reproduction)** 

Additionally, if this PROPOSAL document is graded above T0, there should be existing supporting work referenced for each tier in sequence. For example, if a T4 experiment is proposed there must be a T0, T1, T2, and T3 that exists within the repository referenced with paths for any existing PROPOSAL and RESULTS documents listed. The figures and logs can also be referenced from each of those prior work items. There should be at a minimum of one for each, but no max limit.

In order for any experiment to run or pass, PROPOSAL_ documents MUST be created. Reference some brief approval standards here C:\git\Prometheus_VDM\derivation\code\common\authorization\README.md

## 1. Tier Grade, Proposal Title and Date

## 2. List of proposers and associated institutions/companies

## 3. Abstract

Include a very brief ( <200 words) summary of your proposal’s motivation and anticipated goals.

## 4. Background & Scientific Rationale

Include information sufficient for someone with a background in physics, math, or engineering,
but not necessarily an expert in your subfield, to understand your proposal. Explain the maturity ladder and provenance.

## Some questions to consider

- How novel is this experiment/project?
- Why does the experiment need to be done?
- Are there target findings that would be requisite for future work?
- What specific area of physics (quantum, gravity, electromagnetic, etc.) will this work impact?
- What fundamental question or problem will it address?
- What criticisms might there be of this approach? Should you re-think the proposal based on the answers to this question?
- What are the potential seen or unseen gaps, and what is being done to address them if any?

## 5. Intellectual Merit and Procedure

White paper proposals will be reviewed based on the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of
the proposal. The Intellectual Merit will be judged based on:

**(1)** Importance of the scientific questions addressed.
**(2)** Potential impact of the experiment.
**(3)** Clarity and reasonableness of the experimental approach.
**(4)** Planned level of rigor, and discipline.

## 5.1 Experimental Setup and Diagnostics

- What are the known, required parameters involved in the experiment?
- What diagnostics are needed? Include the number of each required.
- Might there be other unplanned equipment needed?
- Is there any new equipment, tools, or scripts required to be fabricated by the proposer?

## 5.2 Experimental runplan

- Describe how the resources in section 5.1 will be employed to answer the proposed scientific question(s).
- What is the estimated amount of runtime required to carry out the proposed plan?
- What is the plan of action for a successful experiment?
- What is the plan of action for a failed experiment?
- How will the results be published / displayed? (Review the "PAPER_STANDARDS.md" document for Whitepaper format)

## 6. Personnel

Describe the roles of the proposer (Justin K. Lietz) and what will be done by the proposer do to execute the goals of the project.

## 7. References
