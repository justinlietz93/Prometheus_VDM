## Authoring Policy (Comprehensiveness)

- Favor comprehensive and thorough documentation over brevity. When in doubt, include necessary context that directly supports methods, gates, and results.
- Provide enough larger-theory orientation so a technically literate reader can follow the motivation and definitions without external tutorials; keep it focused and evidence-driven.
- Pair every conceptual claim with either a concrete equation, a gate/threshold, or a citation to reputable sources.

## **Introduction**

1. Include a brief overview of the topic and its importance - what is the concept being studied (eg: refractive index, resonant frequency, resistance). Where/how is it used?

2. State the personal or global significance of the topic - what made you choose this and why is it an important topic to investigate?

3. Briefly introduce the main device used in the experiment and state why this is the most appropriate method to use for the experiment (for example, inclined plane, parachute, copper wire, etc).

4. The introduction should be around 0.5 - 1 page.

5. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/64a6ed1b701b5600139b4265) This IA has a good introduction since it briefly introduces the main concept being studied (damping), as well as the global significance of the uses of damping such as swinging doors and amusement park rides, and the introduction is around 0.5 pages long.

## **Research question**

1. State the main research question of the experiment including the independent and dependent variables.

2. Make sure to include units for the independent and dependent variables.

3. Include how the dependent variable will be quantified and measured (instrument name). Explain why this instrument is best for the respective dependent variable.

4. An example research question should look like this: "_To what extent does the salt concentration of water (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 mol/L) affect its specific heat capacity (in_ J/g°C)_, as measured by a calorimeter?_"

5. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/62e9f183879294001428e1b4) This IA has a good research question as it clearly states the research question and the units of the independent and dependent variables.

## **Background Information**

1. Describe the physics behind the main concept being analyzed. Talk about what physical properties are involved in the process (eg: why does salt affect specific heat capacity, why does the diameter of a parachute affect terminal velocity, etc).

2. Discuss the main method used to measure the concept of interest (eg: calorimetry to measure specific heat capacity). What aspects of this method make it suitable to measure the concept being studied?

3. Include any equations that are relevant to the reactions that will occur during the experiment (if applicable).

4. You should justify why the respective method of analysis was chosen for this experiment, for example, why calorimetry? What makes it suitable to answer the research question?

5. If the research is based on secondary data, you should explain the selection of the database used and the method of data sampling used in the secondary data. Explain why this particular database interests you and why it is relevant to answering the posed research question.  

6. All the background information included should be directly focused on the research question. For example for specific heat capacity analysis, you can briefly talk about the structure and polarity of NaCl and how this affects its solubility, but don't spend more than 3-4 sentences talking about salt rather than the physics behind the experiment, which would be discussing specific heat capacity and calorimetry.

7. Include relevant diagrams if applicable. Don't forget to provide a figure caption and cite the source of the diagram.

8. Include in-text citations throughout the background information section.

9. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/64a6ed1b701b5600139b4265) This IA has good background information since it describes the main concept being studied (pendulum damping), and provides the relevant equations for the mechanism occurring. It includes relevant diagrams such as the forces on a pendulum and the angular displacement over time. The background information section is directly focused on the research question and contains in-text citations where applicable.

10. Scope and larger theory (required, concise): Briefly situate the experiment within its parent framework (e.g., metriplectic dynamics; gradient flows), define the minimal terms used later, and explain why the framework is appropriate. Provide 2–4 citations to foundational sources.

11. Core equations (required): Present 3–5 equations that are directly used in Methods/Results (e.g., invariants, discretizations, error models), with variable definitions and units. Keep derivations brief; link or cite for details.

12. Map to gates (required): Explicitly connect each theoretical property to its experimental gate or metric (e.g., “DG ⇒ ΔL ≤ 0,” “Strang ⇒ slope ≥ 2 on log–log two-grid”).

13. If additional context is needed beyond a few paragraphs, add a short “Theory Primer” subsection or an Appendix. Do not omit crucial background—relocate it rather than compressing away needed clarity.

14. Maintain standard terminology first, with any project-specific labels in parentheses, and keep tone objective and evidence-based.

## **Variables**

1. Include the independent variable and units. Describe why the range of independent variables was chosen. For example, why was the height that a parachute is dropped chosen as 10-50cm instead of 50-100cm? You should justify why you have chosen specific values over others.

2. Include the dependent variable, units, instrument with which it will be measured, and the uncertainty. For example in calorimetry, you could write "_Dependent variable: specific heat capacity, measured using a calorimeter (±0.1 J/g°C)_".

3. Add a table of control variables, including how each variable is controlled and why it is controlled.

4. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/6205223f59dfc50013182e6b) This IA has a good variables section since the independent variable is clearly stated with its units, the dependent variable is stated with its units and how it will be measured, and a section of control variables is present that states why and how each variable will be controlled.

## **Equipment / Hardware**

1. Create a list of all the apparatus and equipment used in the experiment.

2. Ensure to include uncertainties for all relevant instruments (eg: thermometer, ammeter, voltmeter, weighing balances, etc).

3. Include the concentrations of all standard solutions used.

4. Include a labelled image of the experimental setup (however you could also include an image in the method section).

5. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/62e9f183879294001428e1b4) All glassware and equipment are stated with their respective uncertainties.

## **Methods / Procedure**

1. Write down each step of the method exactly as it was performed in the lab.

    1. Document your experimental procedure in enough detail that someone else could repeat your work. This should include a list of all materials used, a diagram of the lab setup if appropriate, and the steps taken to accomplish the lab (paragraphs preferred, but organized, ordered lists of instructions are acceptable with list items in complete sentences.)

2. **Materials**

    1. List all materials used.

3. **Diagram of Lab Setup**

    1. Show schematic of experimental setup where necessary.

4. **Steps Taken**

    1. Provide enough information that another student could easily replicate your work.

    2. Use a narrative tone when writing the method and not a first-person tone. For example, you should write "_Prepare a solution of ....." rather than writing "I prepared a solution of......_".

    3. Include a risk assessment table at the end of the method, outlining the safety, ethical and environmental concerns of the experiment.

    4. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/62e9f183879294001428e1b4) All steps of the method are accurately noted down in the narrative tone and no first-person voice has been used. A risk assessment section has been included at the end which accounts for safety, ethical and environmental concerns.

## **Results / Data**

1. Include a table of the processed data from the experiment. Include a number and caption for the table and ensure the data is centred in the cells.

2. Add a section for qualitative data if applicable (eg: colour changes, temperature changes).

3. Ensure all data in tables has the appropriate number of significant figures and decimal places.

4. Include a sample equation and calculation showing how the data is processed. Do this for each type of calculation used (eg: calculating averages, calculating resistance, etc).

5. Place the rest of the processed data in a new processed data table. Include a number and caption for the table and ensure the data is centred in the cells.

6. Include a sample calculation for the propagation of uncertainties, and place the rest of the uncertainties for the other values in a table with a caption. After calculating the uncertainties, include a description of what they mean concerning the data. Is the uncertainty small or large? What does this mean about the error and validity of the results?

7. Include tables / graphs / figures of the processed data versus the independent variable. Include a graph title, axis titles and units, and provide a figure caption for the graph. Include a paragraph below the graph describing the trends in the data such as the correlation if linear (positive or negative) and the R^2 value.

8. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/62e9f183879294001428e1b4) A table of qualitative data, raw data and processed data has been included. All tables have a number and figure caption. Sample calculations are shown for each type of equation used. An appropriate graph has been included.

9. **Explanations**: The key relationship from each table or graph is described in a separate paragraph with appropriate supporting details.

## **IX. Discussion / Analysis**

Open with a statement of key findings, and clearly reference those findings with data from the lab. Provide logical explanations for all statements. Discuss other appropriate findings of interest. Make sure you have answered all analysis questions, and you have answered your research problem as posed in the introduction.

## **Conclusions**

Summarize what you learned in the lab, with specific references to the scientific concept under study which you detailed in the introduction. Describe potential sources of error (don't say human error). Critique the lab and describe opportunities for further / future work. Did you learn anything else from the lab, such as use of lab equipment, procedures, analysis methods, etc.?

1. State the aim of the experiment to refresh the reader's memory.

2. Discuss the trends in the graph and how they correspond to the research question.

3. Use experimental values from the analysis section in the conclusion. For example, instead of just saying that specific heat capacity decreases as salt concentration increases, you could say that the specific heat capacity decreases from 4.5 J/g°C to 2.5 J/g°C as the salt concentration increases from 1 M to 5 M.

4. Discuss the extent to which the research question was answered - was it answered fully or only partially?

5. Discuss the R^2 value of the graph (if the data is linear) and how it describes the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

6. Describe if there are any anomalies in the data, and give reasons as to why these may have occurred.

7. Compare your experimental values to literature values to strengthen your conclusion. Include in-text citations for the literature source.

8. Discuss the impact of uncertainties - were they a significant amount of the experimental values? (For example, 10g ± 0.01g is more acceptable than 10g ± 1g)

9. [**Example:**](https://www.clastify.com/ia/physics/62e9f183879294001428e1b4) The conclusion clearly re-states the aim of the essay, as well as a statement to which the research question has been answered (results support the hypothesis). Graphical trends and uncertainties are discussed in relation to the research question, such as the relationship between the variables. The reliability of the data was also discussed.

### **IMPORTANT NOTES BELOW**

### Terminology & Framing

- **Never introduce custom terminology before defining it.** Give the standard term first, then your label in parentheses.
- **Always define key words once, plainly.** E.g., “training = offline parameter optimization; here we do online adaptation.”
- **Prefer mainstream language over in-house metaphors.** Map “walkers (tracer probes)”, “scoreboard (budgeted gate)”, “memory steering (slow bias field).”
- **State scope in the first paragraph.** Say what the note _does_ and _does not_ claim.
- **Write in the 3rd person.** Avoid 1st and 2nd person references such as I, we, you, and you(understood).

### Claims & Novelty

- **Never imply novelty for classical results.** If it’s known, say “we reuse X as a QC invariant.”
- **Always separate architecture from kernels.** Your system is new; the math blocks can be standard.
- **Make each claim falsifiable.** Attach a metric, a threshold, and a pass/fail outcome.

### Math & Invariants

- **Prove tiny lemmas in one line when possible.** Box the derivative that equals zero.
- **Never mix dissipative RD with “least action” language.** Use “gradient flow / entropy increase / Onsager.”
- **Use dimensionless groups early.** Declare rescalings and drop tildes cleanly.

### Evidence & Reproducibility

- **Always pair every figure with its CSV/JSON.** Same folder, same basename.
- **Emit a contradiction report on failure.** Include gate name, seed, and cell pointer.
- **Pin one artifact path in the text.** Readers need a single click target to the proof.

### Runtime & Scaling

- **Never claim scaling without a log–log slope.** Report β ± CI for step-time vs active sites.
- **Always report P50/P95/P99 latency and jitter.** Show stability over hours.
- **Quantify “no dense scans.”** Log fraction of cells touched per tick; enforce a budget.

### Citations & Prior Art

- **Cite lineage at first use.** Logistic → Verhulst; fronts → Fisher–KPP; gradient flow → Onsager/JKO/AGS; RD patterns → Turing/Murray.
- **Keep related work minimal but present.** Four bullets beat zero citations.
- **Never bury citations in an appendix.** Put them where skepticism arises.

### Naming & Jargon

- **Focus on clarity and masterful communication over convoluted complexity.**
- **Avoid anthropomorphism.** Replace “wants to output” with “emits when threshold crossed.”
- **Explain metaphors or drop them.** If you say “particle-like,” back it with lifetime/velocity/dispersion metrics.

### Figures & LaTeX/Notebooks

- **Never let floats roam.** Use `[!htbp]` and `\FloatBarrier` (or `[H]` sparingly).
- **Caption with numbers, not vibes.** Include R², slope, RMSE right in the caption.
- **One figure = one claim.** Don’t overload panels with multiple unlinked points.

### Thread/Etiquette (r/LLMPhysics survival)

- **Lead with a test, not a thesis.** “Here’s the gate; here’s the artifact path.”
- **Don’t debate venues; debate thresholds.** Invite tighter gates, not opinions.
- **Never reply defensively.** One factual clarification; then point to the artifact.

### Scope & Boundaries

- **State what is _not_ in scope.** E.g., “No claim about novelty of logistic; this note is QC-only.”
- **Distinguish adaptation from training in one line.** Then don’t re-litigate it.
- **Avoid sweeping generalizations.** Keep statements bounded by your artifacts.

### Security/Integrity

- **Log seeds, commits, and environment.** Provenance kills plagiarism accusations.
- **Disclose assistance roles.** “Equations expressed in standard RD form; architecture and tests specified by author.”
- **Never fabricate certainty.** “PROVEN” only after gates pass and artifacts exist.

### Posting Flow (do this every time)

- **Open with TL;DR + one artifact path.** Then details.
- **Include a boxed lemma or boxed gate.** Visual anchors calm skeptics.
- **End with a single invitation.** “Propose a tighter threshold; I’ll run and post the result.”

### Preflight Checklist (print this)

- Title reflects purpose (QC/architecture), not novelty.
- Plain-language definitions appear before any custom names.
- Lemma/proof for any invariant in ≤3 lines.
- Each figure has CSV/JSON + seed + commit.
- Gates: names, thresholds, pass/fail JSON, contradiction report.
- Minimal citations added at first skeptical touchpoints.
- Runtime claims include β slope, P50/95/99, jitter, active-site fraction.
- No anthropomorphism; metaphors quantified or removed.
- Floats anchored; captions numeric.
- OP text leads with artifact path; replies focus on thresholds.

Stick to these and you won’t get blindsided by “made-up jargon” or “unmotivated equations” again; the conversation will be forced onto your tests and artifacts where you’re strongest.
