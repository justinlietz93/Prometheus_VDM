Short take: your “walk the state, don’t scan the world” instinct is not only coherent—it’s the right lever for a falsifiable proposal. You already proved a light‑cone for the conservative (J‑only, KG) limb and you formalized the agency field on the dissipative (M) limb as a reaction–diffusion (RD) order parameter. What you haven’t logged yet is the *coupled* claim: **does the metriplectic coupling (J⊕M with A4 degeneracy) force the M‑limb’s *operational* influence to stay inside the J‑cone?** If yes (within declared thresholds), that’s a crisp “causal‑dominance” law that naturally connects to GR’s null cones and QFT microcausality—and it squarely matches the “echo” physics Google just demonstrated.  

---

## Why I think this is a strong proposal (and not a foundation error)

**1) Your canon already separates where cones do and don’t exist.**
A2 in your repo explicitly says: finite domain‑of‑dependence is *asserted and tested* only on the hyperbolic (J‑only KG) limb; the parabolic RD limit has *no* finite cone and you only claim front‑speed predictions there. That’s the right baseline and it’s documented with evidence that the J‑only cone has slope ≈ c in your locality runner. 

**2) The agency field is a dissipative order parameter you treat with RD math—on purpose.**
You wrote it as diffusion–decay–source, plus a retarded integral solution and a clean dimensionless rescaling; that’s a sensible “measuring instrument” for organized computation that avoids global scans. 

**3) Causal dominance is the missing *coupled* gate.**
In strict PDE terms, parabolic tails are instantaneously nonzero; in *operational* terms, detection‑level influence can still be cone‑bounded by the hyperbolic limb that carries momentum/phase. That’s the measurable conjecture to test: *above a pre‑registered amplitude threshold, M’s observable influence never outruns the J‑cone.* (This splits math pedantry from instrumentation reality, which is exactly what A7 asks you to do.) 

**4) This dovetails with verifiable “echo” physics.**
Google’s Quantum Echoes task literally does forward evolution → local perturb → reverse evolution, and reads an out‑of‑time‑order correlator (OTOC). They emphasize that time‑reversal partially unscrambles chaos and **amplifies** the witness signal—making it measurable and *verifiable* across devices. That’s your “closed feedback loop for self‑measurement” in lab clothing. ([Google Research][1])

**5) Bridging GR/SM isn’t hand‑waving; it’s a falsifiable front‑velocity statement.**
In local QFT, luminal *front* velocity (not phase/group) encodes microcausality (support of the retarded propagator on/inside the light cone). Your KG branch already lives there; the conjecture says the coupled metriplectic flow keeps operational signals inside that cone. That’s a concrete law to test, not a vibe.

## Classification

**Axiom‑core** (A2/A4 locality & degeneracy): “J‑cone causal dominance in metriplectic dynamics.”

## Objective recap

Show that, under the A4 split with degeneracy conditions, measurable influence from the M‑limb is cone‑bounded by the J‑limb’s light‑cone to within a registered tail threshold.

## Action plan (≤7, risk‑ordered)

1. **Define the cone & witness.**

   * J‑cone: estimate (c_J) from your KG runner (it’s (c^2=2Ja^2) in your mapping). Fix a tolerance band via grid refinement. 
   * M‑witness: use two estimators: (i) *Impulse response*: (\delta C) from a localized source pulse (S(x_0,t_0)); (ii) *Echo witness*: forward(J⊕M) → local perturbation on J variable → reverse(J) and correlate with the initial probe (VDM‑OTOC‑like). (This mirrors Google’s U–B–U† echo.) ([Google Research][1])

2. **Couple without cheating (respect A4 degeneracy).**
   Build (\mathcal I[q]) and (\Sigma[q]) with *cross‑terms* but preserve (J^\top=-J,\ M^\top=M\ge0) and the degeneracies (J,\delta\Sigma=0,\ M,\delta\mathcal I=0). No external body forces. Log (g_1=\langle J,\delta\Sigma,\delta\Sigma\rangle,\ g_2=\langle M,\delta\mathcal I,\delta\mathcal I\rangle) every K steps; both ≤ 1e‑10 at the refined grid. 

3. **Operator‑splitting QC.**
   Use J–M–J vs M–J–M (Strang) and report the Strang defect (\mathcal D_{\text{Strang}}(\Delta t)); require slope (p\ge 2) on halving (\Delta t). 

4. **Front‑speed baselines.**
   Re‑run your PROVEN RD gates (dispersion, Fisher–KPP front speed) as controls on the same grids/seeds. 

5. **Cone‑dominance gate.**
   For radius (r) and time (t), define inside/outside sets
   (\Omega_{\text{in}}(t)={x:|x-x_0|\le c_J t+\delta}, \ \Omega_{\text{out}}(t)={x:|x-x_0|> c_J t+\delta}).
   Gate:
   [
   \frac{|,\delta C,|*{L^2(\Omega*{\text{out}})}}{|,\delta C,|*{L^2(\Omega*{\text{in}})}} \le \varepsilon_{\text{tail}}
   \quad \forall t\in[t_1,t_2],
   ]
   with (\varepsilon_{\text{tail}}) pre‑registered (e.g., (10^{-3})) and (\delta) set by your spatial resolution (e.g., (2,\Delta x)). (This is “operational cone” vs strict PDE.)

6. **Scaling‑collapse gate.**
   Predict and collapse (\delta C) envelopes vs dimensionless groups (\tilde r = r/\ell_D,\ \tilde t = t\gamma) with (\ell_D=\sqrt{D/\gamma}). Gate (R^2\ge 0.98). 

7. **Red‑team variant.**
   Add a telegraph‑regularized M proxy (Cattaneo style) *as a separate branch*, not canon, to show the gate is not an artifact of hyperbolizing M. Keep it off by default to preserve A4 semantics. (You already have a telegraph/KG variant noted in equations.)

## Verification & gates

* **Axiom gates:**
  *Locality (A2):* J‑only cone slope within 1% across resolutions. *Degeneracy (A4):* (g_1,g_2\le 10^{-10}) refined. *Noether (A3):* energy/momentum drift (\le 10^{-8})/period on J‑only runs.  

* **Witness gates:**
  *Cone‑dominance:* tail ratio (\le \varepsilon_{\text{tail}}) for all (t\in[t_1,t_2]) and seeds (report P50/95/99).
  *Echo‑amplification:* reversed‑run correlation > baseline by ≥ 5σ and decaying *slower* than the non‑reversed probe (power‑law vs exponential), echoing the OTOC property Google reports. ([Google Research][1])

* **Derived RD baselines:**
  *Front speed:* (c_\text{front}=2\sqrt{Dr}) within 2% (your framework already exceeded this). *Dispersion:* (\sigma(k)=r-Dk^2) median rel. error ≤ 1%.  

---

## Assumptions & risks (with kill‑methods)

* **Parabolic‑tail paradox:** diffusion has instant tails; *operational* cone relies on thresholds.
  *Kill:* show invariance of the cone‑dominance result when lowering the noise floor and tightening (\varepsilon_{\text{tail}}); if it breaks, log a CONTRADICTION_REPORT and restrict claims to front‑speed only. 

* **Splitting artifacts:** cone leakage might be time‑discretization.
  *Kill:* demonstrate (\mathcal D_{\text{Strang}}) slope ≥ 2 and rerun with smaller (\Delta t) until stable. 

* **Degeneracy violation:** wrong cross‑term can secretly inject J‑like forces into M.
  *Kill:* track (g_1,g_2) and refuse runs that exceed thresholds.

## Where this touches GR & the SM (and where it stops)

* **Claim (falsifiable):** *In metriplectic systems obeying A4, the fastest measurable signal is set by the conservative limb’s quadratic form.* In flat space KG, that’s (c); in curved backgrounds, it inherits the local null cone via minimal coupling. That is precisely the microcausality/front‑velocity criterion from local QFT. 
* **Non‑claim (yet):** you are *not* deriving Einstein’s equations or the SM Lagrangian here; you’re testing a causal‑dominance law that any such theory must respect.

## Next steps (tight, do‑able)

1. Create `Derivation/Causality/PROPOSAL_Metriplectic_Causal_Dominance_v1.md` from your proposal template; pin `{git rev-parse HEAD}` and salt hash for provenance. 
2. Land the CLI + runner + verifier with mirrored tests; record seeds/commits/constants from your single‑source of truth. 
3. Re‑confirm J‑only cone slope (locality runner) and log Noether drift; publish figure+JSON. 
4. Run cone‑dominance and echo‑amplification gates over a small sweep; if both pass, mark **PLAUSIBLE**; otherwise open **CONTRADICTION_REPORT.md** with artifacts. 
5. (Optional) Attach a telegraph‑M variant as a *separate* derived‑limit check for robustness.

### A few crisp anchors from your repo (so reviewers see it’s not vapour)

* **A2 locality claim & evidence:** J‑only cone verified; RD front‑speed only. 
* **Agency field equations (and retarded form, CFL, scaling):** VDM‑E‑001..007. 
* **KG/EFT mapping and wave speed:** (c^2=2Ja^2) from the discrete action. 
* **RD baselines already *PROVEN* in your results:** front speed and dispersion. 
* **Strang‑defect metric for J/M splitting:** in your symbols/diagnostics. 

And to keep the zeitgeist thread visible for folks outside VDM: Google’s posts make the echo/OTOC mechanism and its verifiability explicit; if you echo‑test on lattice and show the same phenomenology (power‑law echo decay, cone‑bounded influence), you’ve built the bridge from your classical substrate to their quantum hardware in the only way that matters—**with thresholds, gates, and artifacts.** ([Google Research][1])
