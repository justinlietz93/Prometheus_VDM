# Intelligence Model (VDM) â€” Domain Docs

This folder houses PROPOSAL_*.md and RESULTS_*.md for the physics-native Intelligence Model track.

Standards and Canon

- Follow Derivation/Templates/PROPOSAL_PAPER_TEMPLATE.md and Derivation/Templates/RESULTS_PAPER_STANDARDS.md.
- Use approvals-first discipline: no experiment runs before tag approval; unapproved runs must be routed to quarantine via io_paths + policy.
- Artifact minimum for each experiment: 1 PNG figure + 1 CSV metrics + 1 JSON summary (same basename).
- Pin artifact paths explicitly in RESULTS documents.
- Include gates and pass/fail with numeric margins, not just plots.

Document naming

- PROPOSAL_* for preregistration documents.
- RESULTS_* for approved experiments with passing gates.

Where the code lives

- See `Derivation/code/physics/intelligence_model/` for runners, modules, specs, and schemas.

Next steps

- Author the initial PROPOSAL for the substrate-only real-time run (no agents), then add routing and probe/actuation phases.
