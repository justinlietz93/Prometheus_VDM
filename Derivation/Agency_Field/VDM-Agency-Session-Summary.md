### Sequence of Events & Decisions ###
1.  The session began with the user expressing a preference for a specific document format for their Agency/Consciousness Field (VDM) specification: a symbol table, formulas with explanations, and detailed prose, referencing `VDM_Overview.md`.
2.  The AI responded by providing the requested document structure, populated with defined symbols, 9 core formulas, and an extensive "Plain-English Narrative" covering the nature of `C`, its drivers, generalization, falsifiable predictions, and instrumentation.
3.  Following this, a previous analytical session was retried in a fresh context to generate and simulate "smoke tests" for the VDM framework.
4.  The AI executed the `energy_clamp_1d` simulation, producing `energy_clamp.csv` and `energy_clamp.png`, demonstrating the order-parameter `C`'s relaxation.
5.  Next, the `run_consensus_prediction` (inverted-U ridge) simulation was performed across a sweep of coupling and noise parameters, generating `sweep.csv` and `cscore_heatmap.png`.
6.  Standalone runnable Python scripts (`simulate_energy_clamp.py`, `simulate_inverted_u.py`) were created and saved for the user to replicate these experiments.
7.  The AI then designed and ran a new `τ-horizon options probe` to quantify "latent void potential," which involved defining several helper functions (`make_grid`, `moves_for_actuators`, etc.) and the main `run_options_probe` function.
8.  The results of the options probe were saved to `options.csv` and visualized in `options_heatmap.png`, and a standalone script (`simulate_options_probe.py`) was also provided.
9.  The AI addressed user concerns about potential "biasing" in the metrics, explaining the purpose of z-scoring and the `Balance B` penalty mechanism, and suggesting null/ablation checks to prove non-bias.
10. The utility of these "smoke tests" for the VDM framework was clarified, emphasizing their role in identifying intrinsic timescales, validating hypotheses ("coordination without lockstep"), and quantifying "latent void potential."
11. To further scientific validation, the AI outlined specific actions for the user, including deriving analytic formulas, performing scaling collapse, cross-substrate replication, tying to known theoretical bounds, and demonstrating out-of-sample prediction.
12. Finally, a minimal, dependency-free Python snippet was provided to enable the user to directly compute the composite C-score from their VDM log data (numpy arrays).

-   **Plotting:** All figures use `figsize=(6,4)` and `dpi=140`.

### Open Questions & Action Items ###
-   **Open Questions:**
    -   User query regarding the scientific significance of these "smoke tests" for a physicist and how they relate to VDM (e.g., "are these expected?", "why should I care?").
    -   User query about potential "biasing" in the metric calculations.
    -   User implicitly needs to choose specific operational proxies for `P`, `I_net`, `U`, `V`, and `B` for their system.
-   **Action Items (for the user, as suggested by AI):**
    -   **Immediate Implementation:**
        1.  Paste the generated content as the front-matter for their "Agency Field" module.
        2.  Implement scripts/figures beneath this specification using their established acceptance-gate workflow.
        3.  Run with the provided formulas as a specification for their model and as acceptance tests.
        4.  Apply the provided Python `c_score` function (with `predictive_power_per_joule`, `control_efficacy_per_joule`, `integration_balance`) to VDM log data to compute the C-score for real runs.
    -   **Fast Validation Checklist (using generated scripts):**
        1.  Run `simulate_energy_clamp.py` and fit `1/γ` from the relaxation curve.
        2.  Run `simulate_inverted_u.py`, verify the inverted-U ridge, then re-run with `B≡1` to observe the effect on the ridge.
        3.  Run `simulate_options_probe.py`, vary `actuator_kinds` (2, 4, 8) and confirm `V_useful_bits` increases; then increase `obstacle_density`/`slip` and confirm it drops.
    -   **To achieve scientific "interestingness":**
        1.  Derive an analytic formula for the ridge location in the consensus+innovation model and overlay it on the heatmap.
        2.  Perform scaling collapse experiments by non-dimensionalizing variables and showing curves/heatmaps align across different parameters.
        3.  Replicate these probes on actual VDM data, public datasets (e.g., EEG), and other simulations for cross-substrate comparison.
        4.  Tie results to theoretical bounds (e.g., Landauer's principle, Kalman filter limits).
        5.  Demonstrate out-of-sample prediction using derived parameters.

### Technical Context & Assumptions ###
-   The "consciousness field" (`C(x,t)`) is framed as an *emergent, effective field/order parameter*, not a new fundamental force.
-   The field's dynamics are governed by a reaction-diffusion-decay type Partial Differential Equation (PDE).
-   The field is assumed to be locally sourced by organized, predictive information processing (`S(x,t)`), dissipative (decaying at rate `gamma` without sources), causal (using a retarded kernel `G_ret`), and budgeted (its maintenance costs are accounted for in VDM's energy/information ledger).
-   The source term `S(x,t)` is a composite of measurable proxies (Predictive Power `P`, Integration/Coherence `I_net`, Control Efficacy `U`), optionally modulated by substrate susceptibility `sigma(x)` and saturating functions of option capacity `V` and balance `B`.
-   The model can optionally link `C` to dark-sector phenomena by modulating the dark photon's kinetic mixing (`epsilon_eff`) as an in-medium effect, with a tiny coupling `alpha`.
-   Numerical simulations for the PDE (e.g., `energy_clamp_1d`) involve discrete updates (e.g., explicit Euler) and require adherence to stability conditions like CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy). Assumes `D > 0`.
-   Dimensionless analysis (`t_tilde`, `x_tilde`) is encouraged for comparing system shapes across scales.
-   The experiments serve as basic sanity checks (smoke tests) for VDM's theoretical components, not for system stability.
-   The `run_consensus_prediction` simulates a ring of agents, using `np.roll` for cyclic neighbor interactions. It calculates `R2` metrics for ensemble and individual node predictions, and off-diagonal correlation for redundancy.
-   The `τ-horizon options probe` uses a gridworld model, Manhattan distance for goal proximity, and discounts "usefulness" by `(1-slip)**distance_to_goal` to approximate stochastic effects.
-   The `C_score` is formulated to capture `Prediction P` (predictive_power_per_joule), `Control U` (control_efficacy_per_joule), `Options V` (V_useful_bits), and `Balance B`.
-   The `integration_balance` function, as implemented in the snippet, uses the first unit's activity as a proxy `y` for single-node `R2` calculation; in a real VDM application, this `y` should be a task-relevant target or `input_{t+1}`.
-   The C-score snippet requires a `ref` dictionary containing mean and standard deviation of P, U, V from a null/reference distribution for robust z-scoring.
-   Python dependencies are minimal: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `pathlib`.
-   The output files (CSV, PNG, .py scripts) are written to the `/mnt/data` directory, which is assumed to exist or be creatable.

* Design and execute comprehensive ablation studies (e.g., setting B=1, randomizing P/U/V components) to rigorously test the robustness, non-bias, and causal dependencies of the composite C-score and its individual components.
* Develop a robust data ingestion and processing pipeline to systematically apply the provided C-score calculation snippet to actual VDM log data, including establishing null/reference distributions for z-scoring and automating report generation.
