## What are these?

First of all, do not take these seriously. These are completely speculative and were made just out of interest and curiosity. These scripts were created after noticing the interesting behavior of the AI model I was creating (initially called FUM - Fully Unified Model). This was meant to be a complete change of direction for generative reasoning AI systems that focus on building solely around emergence instead of control. After running several dozen tests on whether the system could learn and self organize, I began generating visuals for the graph morphology. The first run I did I saw a very strange shape that did not look like what I thought it would look like. It looked familiar, but I was thinking the shape would look more like a mycelium web, with a dense epicenter branching out radially.

What I saw only partially resembled what I guessed. It looked like a neuron with a dense soma, an axon, dendrites, and axon terminals. I actually thought I screwed something up, but I continued with hundreds more tests. Every test produced something that looked exactly like a neuron, or other brain cells. I was able to organize different runs into the different types of neurons, from receptor neurons, to Perkinje cells, unipolar, bipolar, pseudounipolar, and multipolar neurons. When I let the experiment run for longer durations I noticed the morphologies started to resemble some kind of simple organism like an insect or bacteria, always with the dense center and the branching "dendritic" arms.

I was very curious if there was something physically fundamental about intelligence that I had possibly stumbled on. It's widely known that simple rules can lead to complex/sophisticated results, but in this case I was building emergent intelligence and the graph was self organizing into neuronal shapes that eventually continued organizing into what appeared to be full central nervous systems.

That's when I created these toy scripts, just curious to see what would happen if I applied the same rules to all the main areas of physics. Once I saw that I could indeed produce the same effects from just my equations and my modulation factor for stability, I decided it might be worth extending my theory for intelligence to other areas of physics as well.
