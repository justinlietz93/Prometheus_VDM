# White Paper Proposal Template

It is MANDATORY and IMPORTANT to include the substance of the outlined topics. The
length of the proposal should not exceed five U.S. letter-sized pages (including figures and references).

## 1. Proposal Title and date

## 2. List of proposers and associated institutions/companies

## 3. Abstract

Include a very brief ( <200 words) summary of your proposalâ€™s motivation and anticipated goals.

## 4. Background & Scientific Rationale

Include information sufficient for someone with a background in physics, math, or engineering,
but not necessarily an expert in your subfield, to understand your proposal.

## Some questions to consider

- How novel is this experiment/project?
- Why does the experiment need to be done?
- Are there target findings that would be requisite for future work?
- What specific area of physics (quantum, gravity, electromagnetic, etc.) will this work impact?
- What fundamental question or problem will it address?
- What criticisms might there be of this approach? Should you re-think the proposal based on the answers to this question?

## 5. Intellectual Merit and Procedure

White paper proposals will be reviewed based on the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts of
the proposal. The Intellectual Merit will be judged based on:

**(1)** Importance of the scientific questions addressed.
**(2)** Potential impact of the experiment.
**(3)** Clarity and reasonableness of the experimental approach.
**(4)** Planned level of rigor, and discipline.

## 5.1 Experimental Setup and Diagnostics

- What are the known, required parameters involved in the experiment?
- What diagnostics are needed? Include the number of each required.
- Might there be other unplanned equipment needed?
- Is there any new equipment, tools, or scripts required to be fabricated by the proposer?

## 5.2 Experimental runplan

- Describe how the resources in section 5.1 will be employed to answer the proposed scientific question(s).
- What is the estimated amount of runtime required to carry out the proposed plan?
- What is the plan of action for a successful experiment?
- What is the plan of action for a failed experiment?
- How will the results be published / displayed? (Review the "PAPER_STANDARDS.md" document for Whitepaper format)

## 6. Personnel

Describe the roles of the proposer (Justin K. Lietz) and what will be done by the proposer do to execute the goals of the project.

## 7. References
