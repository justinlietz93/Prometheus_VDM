## Summary

The Void Dynamics Model (VDM) outlines a comprehensive program of research, focusing on a metriplectic framework where dynamics are governed by coupled conservative (J) and dissipative (M) generators. This framework is rigorously tested through a series of proposals, each featuring specific experimental setups, diagnostics, and strict pass/fail gates to ensure scientific discipline and reproducibility.

**VDM Foundational Principles and Metriplectic Dynamics**
VDM's core dynamics are axiomatically defined, with time-evolution structured as a metriplectic sum, ∂_t q = J(q)δI/δq + M(q)δΣ/δq, ensuring J is anti-symmetric (Jᵀ=-J) and M is positive semi-definite (Mᵀ=M≥0), alongside degeneracy conditions (J,δΣ=0, M,δI=0). This structure is crucial for preserving invariants (J-limb) and enforcing entropy increase (M-limb). The program emphasizes a maturity ladder (T0-T9) for proposals, progressing from conceptual models to external reproduction, with strict provenance, checksums, and artifact management (PNG, CSV, JSON outputs) at every stage.

Several proposals focus on validating the metriplectic integrators. The **Metriplectic Integrator for Mixed Conservative-Dissipative Dynamics** proposes to certify a Strang-composed (J(Δt/2) → M(Δt) → J(Δt/2)) integrator for coupled Klein-Gordon (KG) (J) and Reaction-Diffusion (RD) (M) fields. Key gates include Noether invariant preservation for J-only (drift ≤ 10⁻¹²), H-theorem compliance for M-only (ΔL_h ≤ 0), and global order ≈2 for the JMJ composition (two-grid slope ≈2). The **Metriplectic - Symplectic (KG) + Discrete-Gradient (RD)** proposal extends this, validating exact discrete Noether invariants for linear KG, dispersion fidelity (ω²=c²k²+m²), locality-cone consistency, and algebraic structure checks (skew J, PSD M) for the symplectic KG and discrete-gradient RD components. Specific gates include max per-step drift E_d, P_d ≤ 1e-12, R² ≥ 0.999 for dispersion fits, and a wavefront speed within 2% of c.

The **RD Discrete Conservation vs. Balance** proposal investigates whether the one-step FUM reaction-diffusion update admits an exact global discrete conservation law or a balance law with a Lyapunov monotone. It attempts a symbolic telescoping identity and, failing that, demonstrates an order-of-accuracy residual. KPI gates include exact identity (ΔS ≡ 0) or asymptotic conservation (max|residual| = O(Δt^(p+1))), and Lyapunov drop monotonicity (ΔL_h ≤ 0).

**Agency Field and Steering**
The VDM program includes a dedicated track for the agency field (m), which influences decision-making and trajectory steering. The **A6 Scaling Collapse** proposal tests a dimensionless scaling collapse prediction for Y-junction routing, where branch probability P(A) collapses to a universal curve P(A) = σ(Θ Δm) when plotted against X = Θ Δm. A key gate is that the maximum envelope width of overlayed curves for multiple Θ values must be ≤ 2%. This demonstrates universality and isolates Θ as a slope parameter. The **ADC Response Function: Logistic Slope Equals (Θ)** proposal extends this by verifying that the fitted logistic slope of the decision coupling law P(A)=σ(Θ,Δm) equals the programmed Θ within ±5%, connecting meso-scale agency to micro-level steering gain. Both proposals utilize extensive A4 pre-flight hygiene checks, including tests for time-reversal, Noether drift, H-theorem monotonicity, structural orthogonality, composition sanity, and locality bounds.

The **Agency Curvature Scaling** proposal validates the steering component by measuring the path curvature (κ_path) of test pulses moving in a memory field m(x). It predicts κ_path scales linearly with the transverse gradient magnitude (X=Θ|∇_⊥ m|), independent of pulse details. The primary KPI is linear fit slope stability within ±10% and R² ≥ 0.99. The **Agency Stability Band** proposal aims to map the stability/retention regime of the memory field (m), which evolves according to ∂_t m = γ R - δ m + κ∇² m. It predicts stable, high-SNR retention when the advective/steering dimensionless group (D_a) is greater than or equal to the loss/decay group (Λ), at intermediate diffusion/spread (Γ). The KPI is a distinct band in the (D_a,Λ) plane with retention (>0.8) and boundary reproducibility (Jaccard index ≥ 0.7).

To detect nonlocal coordination, the **Agency Witness (Swap-Test)** proposal introduces a device-independent agency witness. It compares task performance (J, hit-probability) on a baseline field to a counterfactual where the far field is replaced by an isospectral surrogate, preserving local statistics at the agent. A positive witness W(r) = J_real - J_swap, significantly greater than zero (e.g., ≥ 5σ_null), certifies nonlocal coordination, with replication across discretizations. The **Multipartite Coordination Depth (MCD)** proposal extends this to detect genuine multipartite coordination by tiling the domain into disjoint blocks and applying blockwise phase-scrambled perturbations. A superadditivity witness S_k quantifies deviations from additivity, yielding a Coordination Depth Index (CDI). A primary gate is CDI ≥ 3, indicating genuine k-partite coordination, with robustness checks across discretizations.

**Thermodynamic Routing and Wave Flux Meter**
A series of proposals focuses on passive thermodynamic routing and the underlying wave flux meter. The **Wave Poynting-Meter Instrument v1** aims to certify a J-only scalar-wave instrument that measures energy flow using a Poynting-analog flux meter over a frozen channel map V(x,y). This certification proceeds in three phases: Phase A (Meter Bring-up in closed box) ensures energy conservation, local balance (||∂_t e + ∇·s||_L2 ≤ 10⁻⁶), and plane-wave calibration. Phase B (Open-Port Optics) verifies power accounting (d/dt Σe = -∫s·n dℓ within ≤1%), symmetry null (|<F̄_A - F̄_B>|/(F̄_A + F̄_B) ≤ 1%), and port-closure ablation. Phase C (Channel Map Engaged) then tests routing efficiency (η), requiring it to be significantly different from 0.5 when the map favors a channel. The **Wave Flux Meter — Phase B (Open-Ports with Absorber)** proposal specifically extends Phase A to an open-port configuration with a static absorber, auditing power accounting, symmetry null, and absorber efficiency. Gates include mean relative power balance error ≤ 0.1, symmetry null (|<P_L - P_R>|/<|P_L + P_R|>) ≤ 0.05, and absorber efficiency η_abs ≥ 0.9.

The **Passive Thermodynamic Routing v2** (and its variant **Flux Through Memory Channels (Frozen Landscape)**) explores whether a fast transport field ("river") selectively follows a fixed channel landscape derived from a memory field, with the map being read-only. The model uses a metriplectic RD equation for the fast field. Key KPIs include channel-adherence efficiency (η_ch ≥ 0.60), selectivity over a geometry baseline (ΔB_ch, CI excludes 0), and anisotropy (A ≥ 1.5, CI excludes 1). The **Thermodynamic Routing v2 — Prereg Biased Main** specifies precise parameters for a biased-geometry run (e.g., grid 96x48, outlet widths w_A=0.55, w_B=0.35) with strict gates on H-theorem, no-switch identity (bitwise or ∞-norm ≤ 1e-12), RJ spectral fit (R² ≥ 0.99), routing bias (CI excludes 0, margin ≥ 0.02), energy-floor witness (≥ 5σ vs baseline), and robustness.

**Causality and Echo Protocols**
VDM investigates causality beyond traditional metric-based approaches. **Causal DAG Audits for the Void Dynamics Model** proposes lightweight, order-only causality audits. It constructs an event DAG from timestamped events and verifies acyclicity, computes transitive reduction, estimates Myrheim–Meyer dimension, and tests diamond growth scaling. Gates include DAG acyclicity and consistent scaling of interval cardinalities.

Echo protocols are critical for probing reversibility and self-correction. The **T0_PROPOSAL_SIE_Willow-Convergence_v1.md** introduces a T0 concept test of echo stabilization in a metriplectic (J+M) system. It aims to demonstrate that a VDM-style agency loop (measurement of error + corrective pulses) reduces state deviation via a closed feedback mechanism analogous to "Quantum Echoes with Willow". Gates include J skew-symmetry (≤ 1e-12), M positive semi-definiteness, energy non-increase in M-step (≤ 5e-6), echo suppression ratio (≤ 0.80), and re-tessellation invariance (within 2%). The **T1_PROPOSAL_VDM_QIS_Quantum‑Echoes_Metriplectic_v1.md** builds on this as a T1 proto-model, demonstrating self-correction in a metriplectic VDM engine with a time-reversal-style echo sequence. Metrics include echo fidelity (F_echo ≥ 0.90) and error contraction factor (E_contraction ≤ 0.50), alongside baseline improvement (≥ 5x in L2 error) and reproducibility across seeds.

The **T4_PROPOSAL_VDM_QEcho-Convergence_Willow_v1.md** is a T4 preregistration for the convergence of VDM Metriplectic Echo Dynamics with feedback-stabilized quantum echo workflows. It evaluates monotone fidelity recovery (ΔF_k ≥ 0.05 net gain), bounded drift in conservative invariant (|ΔH_k| ≤ 5e-4), and dissipative monotonicity (ΔS_k ≥ -1e-6). The **T4_PROPOSAL_CEG_Metriplectic_Assisted-Echo_Experiment.md** and **T4_PROPOSAL_SMAE_CEG_v1.md** propose to define and test **Counterfactual Echo Gain (CEG)**. CEG measures the improvement in echo fidelity when the system uses its internal model of J and M to assist the time-reversal phase, relative to an energy-matched, model-blind baseline. A key gate is median_seeds(CEG) ≥ 0.05, along with strict adherence to Noether-J drift bounds (≤ 10⁻⁸), H-M monotonicity (ΔΣ ≥ -10⁻¹²), and energy-matching (within 10⁻⁴ relative). Ablations that destroy the self-model must eliminate the gain to confirm causality. This test is positioned as an "operational test of intent," a foundational step towards VDM's broader program of physics-based agency.

The **T4_PROPOSAL_Echo-Limited-Causality-in-Metriplectic-VDM_T4_v1.md** addresses a central causality claim: whether metriplectic coupling imposes a finite domain of influence on the dissipative (M) limb, such that its operational propagation speed does not exceed the J-sector characteristic speed (c). Diagnostics include arrival-time and level-set front tests for the agency field (C(x,t)), with a primary gate that max observed speed ≤ (1+ε_c)c (ε_c=0.02).

**Quantum Field Theory Bootstrap and Decoherence**
VDM aims to bridge to quantum field theory (QFT) principles. The **T0_PROPOSAL_VDM_J-branch_QFT-Bootstrap_and-Metriplectic-Decoherence_v1.md** outlines a disciplined program to retire the "Particle-triad" analogy. It proposes to bootstrap the J-branch as a lattice QFT engine (scalar → Dirac fermions) and introduce the M-branch solely for metriplectic/Lindblad-like decoherence. Gates for T1/T2 include scalar dispersion accuracy (R² ≥ 0.995, MAPE ≤ 1.5%), J-only energy conservation (drift ≤ 0.1%), equal-time commutator proxy (metric ≤ 0.05), Dirac sector validation (doubler suppression), and purity decay (R² ≥ 0.98, rate scales linearly with γ within ±7%). The **T1_PROPOSAL_VDM_J-branch_Metriplectic_Decoherence__ProtoModel_v1.md** implements the T1 scalar J-branch engine, validating against textbook dispersion and conservation, with strict provenance and artifact generation.

The **J_to_Dirac_T4.md** and **Metriplectic_Lindblad_T4.md** documents are responses to critiques, proposing concrete actions to formalize these QFT concepts. They recommend upgrading J-branch to include Dirac (spinor fields, first-order equations, gauge coupling) and modeling M-branch as a Lindblad-compatible metric flow, ensuring complete-positivity and trace-preservation for decoherence. This formalizes the path to fermions from J and M as a decoherence engine, with strict gates on dispersion, norm drift, Aharonov-Bohm phase, and entropy monotonicity.

**Cosmology and Dark Matter**
VDM seeks to connect to cosmological and particle physics observations. The **FRW Continuity Residual Quality Check (v1)** proposal implements a dimensionless continuity-law residual for FLRW cosmology, verifying discrete consistency of input (ρ(t), a(t)) against a default dust (w=0) model. The gate is RMS residual ≤ 1e-6. This serves as a sanity check for background bookkeeping.

The **Quantum Gravity Bridge - Proposal (v1)** aims to build reproducible pipelines connecting VDM's gravitational and portal predictions to public cosmology (Planck, DES) and HEP datasets (LHC/NA64). Phase A focuses on gravity, requiring reproduction of FRW dust sanity and minimal P(k,z) and CMB spectra comparison. Phase B addresses dark photons (DP), implementing noise budget calculators and Fisher estimates, with a gate for Fisher finite-difference relative error ≤ 0.10. The **Decoherence Portals via Dark-Photon Mixing** proposal investigates DP kinetic mixing as a decoherence portal measurable in precision electromagnetic noise spectra and parameter-estimation Fisher budgets. It hypothesizes predictable PSD modifications and reproducible Fisher information scaling. KPIs include PSD sanity (non-negativity, 1/f monotone, thermal floor dominance), Fisher consistency (relative error ≤ 0.10), and exposure scaling sanity (log SNR vs log(τB) slope β ∈ [0.9,1.1]).

The **False-Vacuum Metastability and Void-Debt Asymmetry** proposal studies false-vacuum metastability and a matter-antimatter asymmetry analogue ("void-debt") within VDM. It uses a scalar β-field (tilted double-well potential), announcer fields, and a conserved B-charge (chemical potential or CP-violating coupling). Hypotheses include critical radius scaling for bubble nucleation, exponential false-vacuum lifetime, and net charge production from chemical potential or CP-pumping routes, all governed by precise gates and monitored by explicit "meters" (determinism, H-theorem ledger).

The **Tachyonic Tube Condensation and Spectrum** proposal computes and validates the discrete tachyonic spectrum and condensation profile of a finite-radius cylindrical tube in the FUM scalar EFT with a piecewise mass term. It solves a secular equation for radial modes, projects quartic self-interaction, determines condensate amplitudes, and maps the post-condensation energy landscape to identify preferred tube radii. Gates require high coverage (≥0.95) for spectrum computation and a certified interior minimum for the energy landscape E(R).

The **T2_PROPOSAL_QG_Regge_CDT_v1.md** document, a response to an inquiry about VDM's string-like physics and a QG engine, outlines a roadmap for a background-independent, non-perturbative quantum gravity engine. It leverages VDM's wave-limb for string-like dynamics and proposes modules for Regge/triangulated geometry and Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT). Gates for geometry substrate (G0) include topological sanity (Gauss-Bonnet), variation checks, and reversibility. Classical dynamics of geometry + waves (G1) involve coupling a scalar field to geometry, with gates on flux meter balance audits and constraint drift. Non-perturbative sampling (Q1) via Pachner moves and Metropolis-Hastings leads to observables like finite-size scaling and random walk return probabilities. Matter on quantum geometry (Q2) and robustness audits (Q3) are subsequent steps, leading to predictive surfaces (Q4) such as FRW minisuperspace limits.

**Qualia Program**
The **VDM–Qualia Program** proposes a falsifiable program to map well-documented psychedelic phenomenology (e.g., pinwheel annihilations, fractality, synesthesia, time warping, "entities") to concrete VDM primitives. It hypothesizes conscious activity as fast wave-like fields on maps, steered by a slow memory field (μ). Substances or sober proxies modulate gain and coupling, shifting the J/M balance. Brief high-flux "monsoons" (F) increase flux without permanently rewriting memory, while extended monsoons lead to durable channel edits. The proposal defines dimensionless control knobs (e.g., timescale split ε, overflow Ξ, global synchrony S) and five IRB-friendly psychophysics experiments. For instance, **E1 (Oneness Threshold)** measures global order parameter S and defect density, gating for sigmoid behavior in S and exponential decay of defect density. **E3 (Monsoon Overflow Test)** differentiates transient purity from lasting channel rewrite based on the overflow ratio Ξ, using semantic priming tasks.

**Project Management and Responses to Critiques**
Several documents act as meta-proposals or responses to external critiques, particularly from "Gemini." These documents reinforce VDM's rigorous approach and define actionable steps. The **PROPOSAL_Wave_Flux_Meter_PhaseC_OpenPorts_v1.md** is a roadmap document that sequences concrete checkpoints and defines global rules for all proposals, including adherence to axioms (A3, A4, A6, A7), use of dimensionless KPIs, and strict writeup discipline. It outlines six tracks of work: Wave-Flux Meter, Thermodynamic Routing v2, Agency Field, Metriplectic KG ⊕ RD, Loop-Quench Test, and FRW Continuity/Balance. Each track progresses through the T0-T9 maturity ladder, with specified methods and acceptance gates at each tier.

Critiques related to the "Particle-triad" analogy (J ↔ bosons, M ↔ fermions) led to decisions to demote the analogy to a T0 heuristic and propose falsifiers (Exclusion proxy, Spin/statistics bridge). Furthermore, actions were outlined to add a **PROPOSAL_T3_Calibration_of_Psychophysical_Observables_to_C_Field.md**, aimed at mapping task-level psychophysical observables to C-field parameters with quantified identifiability and predictive validity. Tension regarding "invariant vs asymmetry" in the logistic/void-debt engine resulted in a requirement to split preregistrations into distinct regimes with explicit symmetry assumptions (closed/symmetric for invariants, open/broken for asymmetry production). These responses emphasize VDM's commitment to rigorous, falsifiable claims, precise instrument calibration, and explicit declaration of symmetry-breaking conditions in different regimes.

Overall, the VDM program is characterized by its meticulous attention to numerical and physical rigor, transparent documentation, and a systematic, tiered approach to scientific inquiry, all designed to build a verifiable foundation for complex phenomena from fundamental metriplectic dynamics.
