## Detailed Assessments by Domain

### 1. Conservation Law

#### RESULTS_RD_Discrete_Conservation_vs_Balance.md
**Tier: T2 (Instrument Certification) — PASS**

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Provenance & determinism: Seeds logged, commit hash (implicit from dated run), double precision
- ✅ Meter-specific gates: Two-grid convergence order β ≈ 2 (Euler), β ≈ 3 (Strang, DG); R² ≥ 0.9999
- ✅ H-theorem check: DG RD shows ΔL ≤ 0 per step with identity residuals near machine precision
- ✅ Energy/mass conservation controls: Diffusion-only mass at machine epsilon
- ✅ Artifacts: PNG + CSV + JSON with numeric captions; pinned paths

- DG Lyapunov monotonicity: PASS (violations = 0)
- Controls (diffusion mass, reaction order): PASS

**Notes:** This is exemplary T2 work. The document tests the *meter* (RD steppers), not a phenomenon. Clear separation: no conservation claim for Euler; balance + H-theorem structure validated for DG.

**Promotion readiness:** Ready for T3 if used as part of a physics phenomenon run (e.g., pattern formation).

---

#### PROPOSAL_RD_Discrete_Conservation_vs_Balance.md

**Notes:** This PROPOSAL sets up the T4 structure; the corresponding RESULTS executed it and landed at T2 (meter certification). To reach T6, would need a physics claim beyond meter validation.

**Promotion path:** If used to claim a physics phenomenon (e.g., "RD fronts satisfy this balance law"), pair with T3 smoke → T4 hypothesis → T5 pilot → T6 main.

**Note:** 3 Thermodynamic Routing PROPOSAL files not reviewed in detail; classified conservatively as T1-T4 pending review.

### By Status

- **Instrument-certified (T2)**: 16 items — exceptional foundation with comprehensive metriplectic validation suite
- **Smoke-validated (T3)**: 8 items — healthy pipeline  
- **Preregistered (T4)**: 14 items — mature hypothesis-testing framework with comprehensive coverage
- **Pilot/Main (T5-T6)**: 2 items — early physics claims
- **Robustness/Validation/Reproduction (T7-T9)**: 0 items — future work

**Key Insight:** The shift from earlier estimate (4 T4 preregs) to confirmed (14 T4 preregs) reveals substantially more mature experimental design than initially apparent. This indicates strong progression toward formal hypothesis testing across multiple domains.

## Strengths

1. **Rigorous T2 (Instrument) Culture**  
   Multiple documents show exemplary meter certification:
   - Provenance (commit, seeds, env)
   - Determinism receipts (hashes, bitwise checks)
   - Physics gates (energy, H-theorem, continuity)
   - Contradiction reports on failure
   - Artifacts (PNG + CSV + JSON) with numeric captions

2. **Clear Tier Separation**  
   Documents consistently distinguish:
   - Meter testing (T2): "This tests the solver, not the phenomenon"
   - Smoke runs (T3): "Validates plumbing; diagnostics only"
   - Prereg (T4): "Formal hypotheses with locked gates"

3. **Template Discipline**  
   RESULTS_PAPER_STANDARDS and PROPOSAL_PAPER_TEMPLATE enforce:
   - Whitepaper-grade structure
   - Falsifiable gates with pass/fail
   - Figure pairing (PNG + CSV + JSON)
   - Provenance blocks

4. **Contradiction Routing**  
   Multiple documents show failed-gate handling:
   - CONTRADICTION_REPORT.json on failure
   - Artifacts routed to failed_runs/
   - No claims made when gates fail

---

## Gaps and Recommendations

### Gap 1: Limited T5-T6 (Pilot/Main Preregistered Results)

**Observation:** Only 2 documents reach T5-T6, where formal hypotheses are tested with effect sizes, CIs, and ablations.

**Recommendation:**
1. Identify T3 smoke runs ready for promotion (e.g., A6 collapse, passive routing)
2. Write formal T4 preregs:
   - Lock hypotheses (H0, H1)
   - Define effect sizes and CIs (e.g., "env_max ≤ 0.02 ± 0.005 at 95% CI")
   - Specify ablations/nulls (e.g., "random router should fail with env_max > 0.1")
3. Run T5 pilots to verify power
4. Execute T6 mains with full prereg compliance

### Gap 2: No T7-T9 (Robustness/Validation/Reproduction)

**Observation:** No documents show parameter sweeps (T7), out-of-sample predictions (T8), or external reproduction (T9).

**Recommendation:**
1. For T2-certified meters, add robustness sweeps:
   - RD steppers: vary (D, r, N, Δt); confirm order scaling holds
   - Metriplectic: vary (c, m, grid); confirm structure gates hold
   - Wave meter: vary (c, Δt, domain); confirm energy/balance gates hold
2. For T3 phenomena, make predictive claims:
   - A6 collapse: "Theory predicts env_max ≤ 0.02 for new Θ = X; test prediction"
   - FRW continuity: "Theory predicts RMS ∝ Δt² for sourced case; measure slope"
3. Invite external reproduction:
   - Package runners with Docker/Conda
   - Publish schemas and seeds
   - Offer collaboration for independent verification

### Gap 3: Tier Ambiguity for Some PROPOSAL Documents

**Observation:** Some PROPOSAL_*.md files could be T1 (proto-model) or T4 (prereg) depending on formalization.

**Recommendation:**
1. Review PROPOSAL files and classify:
   - T1: If only equations/toy code (no locked gates)
   - T4: If formal prereg (hypotheses, gates, nulls, schema)
2. Upgrade T1 proposals to T4 by adding:
   - Locked hypotheses with effect sizes
   - Nulls/ablations with acceptance criteria
   - Analysis windows and CI thresholds

### Gap 4: Sparse Concept Seeds (T0) Lineage

**Observation:** T0 documents (concept seeds) lack clear promotion paths to T1.

**Recommendation:**
1. For each T0 concept, define T1 promotion gates:
   - State, control, observable identified
   - Minimal toy equations or simulation
   - Risk/assumptions list
   - One nontrivial consequence derived
2. Create tracking registry:
   - Concept name, date, author
   - T1 promotion gate checklist
   - Target date for toy implementation

## Promotion Roadmap (Sample Paths)

### Path 1: RD Conservation → Pattern Formation (T2 → T6)

**Current:** T2 (meter certified: RD steppers with order scaling, H-theorem)

**Promotion:**
1. **T3 Smoke:** Run Fisher-KPP front with certified DG RD stepper; measure front speed vs theory; show healthy numerics
2. **T4 Prereg:** Lock hypothesis: "DG RD front speed c_meas = c_theory ± σ within 5% over parameter grid (D, r)"
3. **T5 Pilot:** Small grid (N=128); verify power (CI excludes c_theory ± 10%)
4. **T6 Main:** Full grid (N=512); report c_meas with CI; ablations (Euler, Strang) show larger error

**Deliverable:** "Fisher-KPP Front Speed with Certified DG RD Stepper" (T6)

---

### Path 2: A6 Collapse → Routing Universality (T3 → T6)

**Current:** T3 (smoke: collapse gate passes with env_max ≈ 0.0166)

**Promotion:**
1. **T4 Prereg:** Lock hypothesis: "Logistic router family collapses with env_max ≤ 0.02 ± 0.005 at 95% CI over N routers; null: random router shows env_max > 0.1"
2. **T5 Pilot:** Test 5 routers; verify CI; estimate required N
3. **T6 Main:** Test 20 routers; report env_max distribution; ablation (random) fails as predicted

**Deliverable:** "Junction Logistic Universality via Scaling Collapse" (T6)

---

### Path 3: Wave Flux Meter → Photonic Routing (T2 → T6)

**Current:** T2 (Phase A certified: energy, balance gates pass)

**Promotion:**
1. **T3 Smoke (Phase B):** Add open ports with absorbers; verify power accounting; show no-switch holds
2. **T4 Prereg (Phase C):** Lock hypothesis: "Routing KPI F_A / F_B = X ± σ for channel map V(x,y); null: uniform V shows F_A ≈ F_B"
3. **T5 Pilot:** Small domain; verify KPI above noise; estimate required T
4. **T6 Main:** Full domain and time; report F_A/F_B with CI; ablations (different V) show predicted shifts

**Deliverable:** "Photonic Routing via Wave Flux Meter" (T6)

---

### Path 4: Tachyonic Tube → Condensation Prediction (T2 → T8)

**Current:** T2 (solver certified: spectrum coverage, condensation curvature)

**Promotion:**
1. **T3 Smoke:** Run tube scan over (σ, α, λ) grid; show R★ varies as predicted; healthy numerics
2. **T4 Prereg:** Lock hypothesis: "R★ = f(σ, α, λ) ± σ according to analytic approximation; null: random params show no min"
3. **T5 Pilot:** Test 5 param tuples; verify CI; estimate required grid
4. **T6 Main:** Test 50 tuples; report R★ vs theory with CI; ablations (flat background) fail as predicted
5. **T7 Robustness:** Vary (geometry, k≠0, off-diagonal λ); confirm R★ persists
6. **T8 Validation:** Out-of-sample: predict R★ for new (σ, α, λ) using fitted model; measure prediction CI hit rate

**Deliverable:** "Tachyonic Condensation Length Scale: Predictive Validation" (T8)

---

## Recommendations by Priority

### High Priority (Next Quarter)

1. **Formalize T4 Preregs for Strong T3 Candidates**
   - A6 collapse → routing universality
   - Passive routing → biased geometry KPIs
   - Wave meter Phase B/C → photonic routing

2. **Add T5 Pilots for Existing T4 Preregs**
   - Run small-scale versions to verify power
   - Estimate required N, T, grid resolution
   - Document pilot results with CI estimates

3. **Complete T6 Mains for Piloted Work**
   - Execute full-scale runs with locked preregs
   - Report KPIs with CIs and ablations
   - Emit whitepaper-grade RESULTS documents

### Medium Priority (Next Two Quarters)

4. **Add T7 Robustness Sweeps for T2 Meters**
   - RD steppers: (D, r, N, Δt) sweeps
   - Metriplectic: (c, m, grid) sweeps
   - FRW: (w, sourced) sweeps

5. **Develop T8 Predictive Validation Framework**
   - Fit empirical models (e.g., R★ vs params)
   - Generate out-of-sample predictions
   - Measure CI hit rates

6. **Prepare for T9 External Reproduction**
   - Package runners (Docker, Conda envs)
   - Document schemas and seeds
   - Identify external collaborators

### Low Priority (Future Work)

7. **Upgrade T0-T1 Concepts to Proto-Models**
   - Add state/control/observable definitions
   - Write minimal toy equations or code
   - Document one nontrivial consequence

8. **Clarify Tier Classification for Ambiguous PROPOSALS**
   - Review Agency Field, Quantum, Info/Qualia PROPOSALS
   - Classify as T1 (proto) or T4 (prereg)
   - Upgrade T1 → T4 where feasible

---

## Artifact Quality Assessment

### Exemplary Practices (Keep Doing)

1. **Provenance Discipline**
   - Commit hashes, seeds, environment receipts
   - Determinism checks (bitwise, hashes)
   - No-switch clauses where applicable

2. **Figure Pairing**
   - PNG + CSV + JSON with same basename
   - Numeric captions (R², slope, gate values)
   - Pinned paths in document body

3. **Gate Transparency**
   - Thresholds stated upfront
   - Pass/fail with margin reported
   - Contradiction routing on failure

4. **Scope Declarations**
   - "No novelty claim for X; this is QC only"
   - "Meter testing, not phenomenon"
   - "Out of scope: Y, Z"

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Incomplete Artifact Bundles**
   - Some documents reference "awaiting run" or "to be pinned"
   - Recommendation: Complete runs or mark as T0/T1 drafts

2. **Inconsistent Tier Labeling**
   - Some documents don't explicitly state tier
   - Recommendation: Add "Tier: TX" header to all RESULTS/PROPOSALS

3. **Sparse Out-of-Sample Validation**
   - Few documents test predictions beyond training data
   - Recommendation: Add T8 validation for mature meters

---

## Conclusion

The VDM project exhibits **strong T2 (Instrument) and T3 (Smoke) foundations**, with rigorous meter certification, provenance discipline, and clear tier separation. The pipeline is healthy: meters are certified before phenomena are claimed, gates are falsifiable, and contradiction routing is consistent.

**Key strengths:**
- Exemplary T2 work (10 items): RD steppers, metriplectic operators, wave meters, FRW continuity, tachyonic tube solvers
- Solid T3 validation (8 items): A6 collapse, passive routing smoke, cosmology checks
- Emerging T4 structure (4 items): formal preregs with hypotheses and gates

**Key gaps:**
- Limited T5-T6 (2 items): few pilot runs and full preregistered results
- No T7-T9 (0 items): missing robustness sweeps, out-of-sample validation, external reproduction

**Priority actions:**
1. Promote strong T3 candidates to T4 preregs (A6 collapse, passive routing, wave meter Phase B/C)
2. Add T5 pilots for existing T4 work (power checks, CI estimates)
3. Execute T6 mains with full prereg compliance (KPIs, CIs, ablations)
4. Plan T7 robustness sweeps for certified T2 meters
5. Develop T8 predictive framework (out-of-sample hit rates)

With focused effort on T4-T6 promotion over the next 1-2 quarters, the VDM project can transition from **strong instrumentation** to **validated physics claims** with preregistered hypotheses, effect sizes, and robustness checks.
