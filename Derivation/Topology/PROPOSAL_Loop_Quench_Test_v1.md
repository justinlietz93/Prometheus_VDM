## 3. Abstract

We test whether dissipative dynamics suppress long-lived cycle pathologies. In a 2D RD toy system we threshold an excursion set and count simple cycles (graph cycle basis) while logging the discrete Lyapunov (L_h). KPI: negative correlation between (\Delta L_h<0) and cycle count; loop lifetime distribution with a fast decay tail, consistent with “loops as transient but governed.”

## 4. Background & Scientific Rationale

Your model treats persistent loops as pathological “sinks” and healthy concepts as clustered territories. The H-theorem suggests dissipation quenches pathologies. This experiment upgrades that claim into a measurable coupling between energy descent and loop suppression.

## 5. Intellectual Merit and Procedure

Bridges topology-lite observables to physics (Lyapunov) with falsifiable correlations and lifetimes.

## 5.1 Experimental Setup and Diagnostics

* **Domain:** `Derivation/code/physics/topology/`
* **Dynamics:** 2D RD with stable explicit scheme; no-flux boundaries.
* **Observables:** binary mask of (\phi>\tau); simple cycle count via cycle basis; (L_h=\sum(D/2|\nabla\phi|^2+\hat V(\phi))).
* **Diagnostics:** Kendall (\tau) between loop count and (-\Delta L_h); loop lifetime histogram; budget residual sanity.

## 5.2 Experimental runplan

* Initialize with random blobs; evolve under RD.
* At each step: update (L_h); count cycles; track lifetimes.
* **Gates:** Kendall (\tau \le -0.7) with (p<10^{-6}); lifetime tail fit slope (>2) (fast decay).
* **Failure plan:** refine grid/time step; adjust threshold (\tau) for robustness; log contradictions.
* **Publication:** RESULTS with lifetime plot, correlation table, and pinned artifacts.
