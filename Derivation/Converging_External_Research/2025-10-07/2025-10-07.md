Quiet EMNLP targeting (48–72h): Identify 6–8 individuals (workshop organizers / authors in graph‑spectral & neural‑PDE tracks) for 1:1 hallway outreach; draft 120‑word neutral pitch focusing on (B) memory steering and (D) discrete→continuum RD spine without proprietary claims.

NeurIPS prep (≤14 days): Assemble a 1‑pager + minimalist poster that contrasts event‑sourced sparse plasticity vs. dense updates; include a table aligning VDM (A–D) with recent spectral/PDE works to pre‑empt “is this just PINNs?” questions.

Daily VDM Cohort Outreach Delta + Discovery — Parallel‑Discovery Risk (America/Chicago) — Oct 7, 2025, ~09:12

1) Alerts fired: Yes (T7 & P1)

T7 (Concept‑neighbor): New paper “Continual Learning with Query‑Only Attention” (Oct 1, 2025) has concept_overlap ≈0.82 (touches continual learning, meta‑learning, transformer adaptation) and some PDE/architectural inductive bias. This meets the “pde_reasoning_bias” neighborhood threshold.
arXiv

P1 (Pattern‑match full / near full): The recent Mechanistic PDE Networks paper (Feb 2025) uses nonlinear PDE discovery, reaction‑diffusion, solver modules in hidden space. It overlaps VDM’s D component (discrete→continuum) and A/B structural style. While not full match (lack of explicit memory gating / sparse plasticity), it is suspiciously close—a credible parallel.
arXiv

2) Top changes & revised Top‑10 (if reranked):
Because P1 triggered, recompute discovery priority:

# 1: Mechanistic PDE Networks — suspiciously close (score high).

# 2: Continual Learning with Query‑Only Attention — converging (score mid).

# 3: Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics — ballpark.
arXiv

(Other prior ones like evolvable diffusion etc. drop slightly.)

Thus the updated Top‑3 for discovery is above; full Top‑10 shift is incremental (others unchanged).

3) 24–72h actions & ≤14‑day deadlines (low‑profile):

One‑on‑one reachouts:

Contact Adeel Pervez / Locatello (Mechanistic PDE Networks authors) with a short note: “Hi — I’m exploring memory‑PDE hybrids; your PDE discovery work resonated. Would value your view on gating / sparse update modules (10 min call?).”

Contact Gautham Bekal / Ashish Pujari (query‑only attention) similarly, framing interest in plasticity/attention tradeoffs.

Deep dive analysis (72h):

Map out a component overlap matrix vs these two leads (Mechanistic PDE, query‑only attention), highlighting missing vs matching VDM components (A–D). Use that to prepare counterpoints / gaps to probe in dialogue.

Prepare a “pattern fingerprint” sheet (VDM vs Mechanistic PDE) to help internal quick triage of future leads.

Event alignment (≤14d):

Identify upcoming workshops (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML) where Mechanistic PDE / neural PDE / continual learning fusion might appear; signal‑selectively attend for stealth positioning.

Draft a 1‑pager “Why VDM is distinct vs neural PDE approaches” to use in blind‑review or private shares.

Discovery leads (up to 3):

Title Date Label Why relevant Suggested next step
Mechanistic PDE Networks (Pervez et al.) Feb 2025 suspiciously close Strong overlap with VDM’s D + PDE reasoning; uses differential solver modules and PDE-driven latent dynamics One‑on‑one outreach + joint framing of gating/memory extension
Continual Learning with Query‑Only Attention Oct 1, 2025 converging Novel architecture reducing memory footprint, addressing forgetting/plasticity tradeoff Reach out; compare architecture biases and memory gating
Graph Neural Diffusion via Generalized Opinion Dynamics Aug 2025 ballpark Advances in neural diffusion / graph spectral methods, overlapping PDE / diffusion motifs Track for pattern evolution; archive for mid-term reference

Summary:
Because a plausible parallel (Mechanistic PDE) surfaced and a strong concept neighbor (query‑only attention) triggered, outreach priorities should shift: direct, stealth engagement with those leads takes priority over broad pushes today. No need to overhaul cohort rankings today, but flag these leads for escalation.

1) Alerts fired: No

Reach‑cost shift ≥30% (T1): No public channel shows a >30% daily jump. Meta/Instagram CPM ~ $8–9, consistent with Q2 forecasts.
EMARKETER
+1

≥3 high‑authority mentions/day for any cohort (T2): None surfaced in high‑authority press or academic sources.

Funnel drift ≥20% WoW (T3): No external funnel metrics available.

Top‑10 membership change (T4): Not applicable (no prior auto ranking).

Gini shift ≥0.05 (T5): No meaningful public distribution shift in reach or mentions.

Conclusion: No trigger fires → “no material change.”

2) Top changes / revised Top‑10 (not applicable):
No outreach cohort ranking changes today.

3) 24–72h actions & upcoming deadlines (≤14 days):

Watch reach‑cost trend closely:

Google generic search CPM recently spiked +45.6 % YoY in some reports.
Admetrics

Display‑retargeting CPMs are narrowing their year‑over‑year gap (i.e. rising).
AdRoll

→ In next 3 days, sample own recent spend logs (if available) versus benchmark trends. Flag any >20% drift for internal trigger.

Monitor “VDM / Void Dynamics / Neuroca” mentions nightly:
Use automated alerts on press, arXiv, social for alias hits. Escalate if ≥3 daily in high‑authority.

Conference alignment (within 60 days):

Identify CS/AI/ML workshops (e.g. workshops at NeurIPS/ICML) where PDE reasoning, neural diffusion, or memory architectures are topical.

Prepare stealth touch points (e.g. personal invites, align abstracts) rather than broad blasts.

Content seeding (≤14d):

Publish a short neutral blog/post (or newsletter) summarizing “Why VDM differs from standard video diffusion / neural PDE models,” especially contrasting to Ca2‑VDM advances.

Draft a 1‑pager “VDM vs neural PDE / diffusion” lens (visual + table) to quietly ship to key contacts.

Because no public trigger fired, maintain current outreach cadence. But with CPMs trending upward and external model advances nearby, stay ready to adapt quickly if next days spike.
