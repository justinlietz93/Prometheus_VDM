# Converging External Research

## Mark one of these as defined

- [USEFUL] : Research that is not a threat to our provenance, but proves useful for furthering our own work.
- [THREAT] : Research that is directly gaining attention and credits for things we were discovering but haven't published.
- [PARALLEL] : Research that is seemingly solving different problems but using similar strategies conceptually or physically.
- [COLLECTED] : Research artifacts (papers, data, etc) have been collected but not reviewed.
- [] : Listed and nothing else

### Item notes

There will be "next steps" if available, mark [DONE] if completed or [PENDING] if working on it.

## October 9, 2025 A

### Overall Tasks

- Monitor any calls for proposals in “operator learning + memory / dynamics” + “spatiotemporal operator networks” themes.
- Raise alert threshold so that if either appears >2 high-authority mentions/day, we trigger a re‑rank.
- Search for PDE / operator / dynamics workshops in next 60 days (e.g. in November/December).

### Top‑10 PDE / operator / hybrid cohort slice (reordered modestly)

- [] DyMixOp (new highest)
  - [] Analyze DyMixOp architecture in detail. Identify if any latent gating, forget/write signals, or curvature-based memory proposals could be overlaid.
  - [] Email Pengyu Lai / coauthors (DyMixOp), referencing interest in combining local-global mixing with memory gating, propose 15‑min call.
  - [] Add “DyMixOp” and “Self‑supervised neural operator (SNO)” to persistent watchlist.
  - [] Check if DyMixOp / SNO authors are scheduled for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR workshops.
- [] Self‑supervised Neural Operator (SNO)
  - [] Examine SNO’s “on‑the‑fly data generation” module: is there a substrate for embedding memory updates or sparse events?
  - [] Reach SNO authors with “curiosity: can your PI‑sampler be modulated by internal memory states?”
- [] Multimodal PDE Foundation
- [] Numerical Method‑Informed PDE nets
- [] MORPH / latent PDE hybrids
- [] Wave‑PDE nets
- [] CALM‑PDE / conditional PDE transformer
- [] DGNO (probabilistic operator)
- [] Diffeomorphism Neural Operator
- [] FNO‑DEQ / equilibrium operator hybrids

## October 9, 2025 B

- Monitor any calls for proposals in “operator learning + memory / dynamics” + “spatiotemporal operator networks” themes.

### Items

- [] ST‑SSM (new)
  - [] Read and reverse‑engineer ST‑SSM: trace how it factorizes temporal memory and spatial operator coupling. Determine which VDM components are missing (event sparsity, void regulation).
  - [] Email authors of ST‑SSM (Nodens Koren / Samuel Lanthaler) with curiosity about memory gating layers—share VDM context at high level, request short call.
  - [] Add ST‑SSM to persistent watchlist aliases.
  - [] Raise threshold: if ST‑SSM or DyMixOp appear >2 high-authority mentions/day, trigger full reranking.
  - [] Check whether ST‑SSM authors or DyMixOp authors are presenting in ICLR / NeurIPS / operator‑PDE workshops in next 60 days.
- [] DyMixOp
  - [] Compare DyMixOp’s Local‑Global Mixing against ST‑SSM’s memory coupling; map potential hybridization paths.
  - [] Follow up with DyMixOp authors referencing deeper memory + dynamics fusion ideas.
- [] Neural Functional (if already in list)
- [] Multimodal PDE Foundation
- [] Numerical Method‑aware PDE nets
- [] MORPH / latent PDE hybrids
- [] CALM‑PDE / conditional PDE transformer
- [] SINO (Spectral‑Inspired Operator)
- [] Phi‑FEM‑FNO (geometry + operator)
- [] Wave‑based / diffusion‑operator hybrids

### Reverse engineering & fingerprinting:

Deconstruct Multimodal PDE Foundation Model (arXiv) to evaluate presence/absence of memory gating, plasticity, write/forget regulation.

Similarly analyze the “Numerical Method‑Informed Neural Networks” work for how they fuse discrete schemes + learning.

### Low‑profile outreach:

Prepare a brief outreach draft to authors of Multimodal PDE Foundation Model (mention interest in operator + memory fusion)

Reach out to De Luca / Marcellino (numerical‑informed PDE paper) with “curiosity about blending your method with adaptive gating”

### Event / CFP monitoring:

Monitor CoLLAs 2025 (lifelong learning agents) — call for papers open. 
Lifelong ML

Track CFP for KDD 2026 (research track) as a venue to insert PDE + memory hybrid ideas. 
KDD 2026

Watch for late-break workshop CFPs in ML / PDE / operator domains (±60 days) via WikiCFP / AI deadline aggregators.

### Alert subscription updates:

Add “Multimodal PDE Foundation Model” and “Numerical‑Method‑Informed PDE nets” to your persistent watchlist.

Raise alert thresholds such that ≥2 high‑authority mentions in one day trigger re‑evaluation.
