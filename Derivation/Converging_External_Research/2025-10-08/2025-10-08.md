# Converging External Research

## Mark one of these as defined

- [USEFUL] : Research that is not a threat to our provenance, but proves useful for furthering our own work.
- [THREAT] : Research that is directly gaining attention and credits for things we were discovering but haven't published.
- [PARALLEL] : Research that is seemingly solving different problems but using similar strategies conceptually or physically.
- [COLLECTED] : Research artifacts (papers, data, etc) have been collected but not reviewed.
- [] : Listed and nothing else

### Item notes

There will be "next steps" if available, mark [DONE] if completed or [PENDING] if working on it.

## October 8, 2025

- Monitor any calls for proposals in “operator learning + memory / dynamics” + “spatiotemporal operator networks” themes.

### Items

- [] Multimodal PDE Foundations (new)
- [] Numerical‑method informed PDE nets (new)
- [] Wave‑PDE Nets (if still on watchlist)
- [] MORPH PDE foundation
- [] CALM‑PDE / latent PDE hybrids
- [] Physics‑informed control / PDE constrained optimization
  - [] SpringerLink
- [] DIMON geometry‑adaptive PDE nets
  - [] Communications of the ACM
- [] Neural operator / deep operator nets advances
- [] Continual / streaming memory gating
- [] Spacetime / field reasoning groups

### Reverse engineering & fingerprinting

Deconstruct Multimodal PDE Foundation Model (arXiv) to evaluate presence/absence of memory gating, plasticity, write/forget regulation.

Similarly analyze the “Numerical Method‑Informed Neural Networks” work for how they fuse discrete schemes + learning.

### Low‑profile outreach

Prepare a brief outreach draft to authors of Multimodal PDE Foundation Model (mention interest in operator + memory fusion)

Reach out to De Luca / Marcellino (numerical‑informed PDE paper) with “curiosity about blending your method with adaptive gating”

### Event / CFP monitoring

Monitor CoLLAs 2025 (lifelong learning agents) - call for papers open.
Lifelong ML

Track CFP for KDD 2026 (research track) as a venue to insert PDE + memory hybrid ideas. 
KDD 2026

Watch for late-break workshop CFPs in ML / PDE / operator domains (±60 days) via WikiCFP / AI deadline aggregators.

### Alert subscription updates

Add “Multimodal PDE Foundation Model” and “Numerical‑Method‑Informed PDE nets” to your persistent watchlist.

Raise alert thresholds such that ≥2 high‑authority mentions in one day trigger re‑evaluation.
