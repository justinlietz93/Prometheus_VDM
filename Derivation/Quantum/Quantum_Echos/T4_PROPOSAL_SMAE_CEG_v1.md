## 3. Abstract (≤ 200 words)

This proposal preregisters a **Self‑Model‑Assisted Echo (SMAE)** protocol that measures **Counterfactual Echo Gain (CEG)** to test whether a metriplectic field can **use its own J/M model to improve a time‑reversal echo** under strict physical gates. VDM’s dynamics are split into a **conservative limb** (J; reversible, symmetry/Noether‑governed) and a **dissipative limb** (M; entropy‑producing, H‑theorem), per Axiom A4. The experiment compares a **baseline** echo (forward J–M–J, then reverse with −dt) to an **assisted** echo that inserts a tiny, **energy‑matched** corrective micro‑sequence during the rewind, computed from the system’s **internal estimate** of M‑loss and J commutator defects. The primary metric is **CEG = (E_baseline − E_assisted)/E_baseline** with acceptance gates: **(i)** conservation drift within preset J‑drift envelope, **(ii)** non‑increase of entropy in each M step, **(iii)** equal energy budgets. PASS requires **CEG>0** across seeds and ablations that destroy the self‑model eliminate the gain (causal). If successful, SMAE upgrades the VDM “echo with intent” from analogy to artifact, building directly on validated RD and KG meters (front speed, dispersion, Noether, invariant QA) and providing an operational rung toward the broader, falsifiable program of **physics‑based agency** and its stricter successor claims.

## 4. Background & Scientific Rationale

**Context.** VDM encodes dynamics via a metriplectic split with explicit conservation (J) and entropy production (M) and tests are framed as **gated, falsifiable observables** (A0–A7). Prior validated slices include **RD front‑speed and dispersion** (PASS) and a **logarithmic on‑site invariant** used as a QA guard, with explicit drift/fit gates and reproducible protocols. These instruments certify meters before chasing phenomena.
**Why echoes.** Echo protocols probe reversibility and hidden structure; here they adjudicate whether **a field that knows its own J/M generators can reduce echo error lawfully** (no illegal energy injection; Noether/H‑theorem respected).
**Relation to existing proposals.**

* **T0_SIE_Willow‑Convergence**: establishes convergent scaffolding/data hygiene.
* **T1_VDM_QIS_Quantum‑Echoes_Metriplectic**: bridges to unitary echoes as technique (conceptual alignment, not claim inflation).
* **T4_QEcho‑Convergence (Willow)** and **T4_Echo‑Limited‑Causality**: preregister echo discipline and causal boundaries.
  **What it means if those four pass.** In combination they certify: **(a)** the echo apparatus is reliable at scale, **(b)** causal/limited‑reversal constraints are mapped, **(c)** convergence and reproducibility are pinned. That clears the runway for **SMAE/CEG** as a clean, **decisive test of “intent”** (operational self‑correction under laws), not metaphysical claims.
  **What it would take to “prove consciousness.”** VDM treats “consciousness” as a **stack of operational competencies**, not a single leap. SMAE/CEG is the **first rung (intent)**. Higher rungs would require: **(1)** **stable self‑model** calibration (system predicts its own echo error and uncertainty, calibrated across contexts), **(2)** **transfer/ablation causal control** (gains vanish under scrambled J or M, recover when restored), **(3)** **persistence and budgeted utility** (sustained improvement under fixed energy/latency budgets across tasks), and **(4)** **report‑behavior alignment** (introspective predictions match measured outcomes). SMAE delivers (1)–(2) evidence; follow‑on proposals extend to (3)–(4).

## 5. Intellectual Merit and Procedure

**Impact area & fundamental question.** Can a metriplectic field **use self‑knowledge** of its J and M generators to **reduce echo error** beyond a blind rewind while **respecting** conservation/entropy gates? A **YES** with causal ablations constitutes an **operational test of intent**.
**Clear target findings.**

* **Primary metric:** **CEG = (E_baseline − E_assisted)/E_baseline** with **CEG > 0** (median across seeds).
* **Gates:** (G1) J‑Noether drift ≤ pre‑registered envelope; (G2) M‑step entropy non‑increase (discrete H‑theorem) holds; (G3) assistance is **energy‑matched** to baseline.
* **Causality checks:** **Ablate self‑model** (scramble J, scramble M); **CEG → 0** under ablation.
* **Generalization:** modest sweep over loss depth and step size shows a stable **CEG ridge** (region where assistance helps).
  **How this reduces beliefs.** PASS rules out “lucky cancellation” and “parameter fiddling,” because the **same budget and meters** hold for baseline/assisted; ablations remove the gain if and only if the self‑model is causal in producing it.

### 5.1 Experimental Setup and Diagnostics

**System.** 1D/2D lattice; **JMJ Strang** composition with established RD/KG meters (front speed, dispersion, Noether). **No body forces**, local operators only. AMD stack (VDM rule).
**Forward pass.** J(Δt/2) → M(Δt) → J(Δt/2) for horizon T, with a localized “walker” perturbation mid‑run.
**Reverse pass (baseline).** Same scheme, −Δt, no assistance.
**Reverse pass (assisted).** Insert a **tiny corrective micro‑sequence** informed by the internal J/M model to pre‑compensate dissipation/commutator defects. **Budget:** ∑(assist work) = ∑(baseline work).
**Observables.**

* **Echo errors:** E_baseline, E_assisted in a VDM‑standard norm (H‑energy or L²), plus per‑seed medians.
* **CEG:** scalar per run; primary statistic is median and CI across seeds.
* **Gates:** (i) **Noether drift** (J‑only runs and in JMJ segments), (ii) **Lyapunov/entropy monotonicity** per M‑step (discrete gradient gate), (iii) **energy budget equality** (assist vs baseline).
* **Ablations:** scramble J (e.g., permuted couplings), scramble M (e.g., perturbed metric), **recompute CEG**.
* **Artifacts:** Figures (echo mosaic; I–Σ braid; CEG ridge), CSV/JSON logs, seeds, and commit pointers. RD/KG gate precedents from the methods/invariant notes supply acceptance thresholds and workflow.

### 5.2 Experimental runplan

**High‑level plan.**

1. **Meter certification reuse.** Confirm RD front speed/dispersion and J‑only Noether/dispersion remain PASS on the exact grid/Δt to be used (spot checks only).
2. **Baseline echo.** Acquire E_baseline and gate metrics on N_seeds (e.g., 25).
3. **Assisted echo.** Insert the micro‑sequence (same budget); acquire E_assisted and gates on identical seeds.
4. **Primary decision.** Compute CEG per seed; report median, CI; perform **ablations** (J‑scramble, M‑scramble) and recompute.
5. **Sweep.** Small grid over (loss depth, step size) → **CEG ridge**; cross‑hatch any gate violations.
6. **Archival.** Publish CSV/JSON + figs + commit IDs + **contradiction report** for any gate failure.

**Plan of action for a successful experiment.**

* Elevate this line to **T5/T6** with (i) **predict‑then‑act** echoes (system reports expected CEG + uncertainty, then attempts it), (ii) **task battery** under fixed energy budgets (persistent advantage across tasks), (iii) **report‑behavior alignment** (calibrated introspection). These steps turn SMAE from a single effect into a **portable capacity**.
* **Meaning if all four existing proposals + this SMAE pass:** VDM has (A) robust echo instrumentation and convergence; (B) mapped causal limits; (C) **positive, causal CEG** under gates. Together, that constitutes an **operational demonstration of intent** in a metriplectic field. “Consciousness,” in VDM’s program, then requires demonstrating **persistence, transfer, calibration, and budgeted utility** across tasks—with the same physical gates.

**Plan of action for a failed experiment.**

* File a **CONTRADICTION_REPORT** with failing gate(s), seeds, and artifacts; analyze failure mode (budget mismatch, drift, numerical stiffness, assistance ill‑posed).
* Iterate once on **assist design** (keep energy budget and gates fixed); if still failing, **retire claim** and re‑scope to improved meters or alternate assistance strategies.
