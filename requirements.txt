# FUM Demo â€” Base dependencies (GPU-specific torch is managed separately)

# Note: Do NOT install the default CPU-only torch from PyPI on AMD/ROCm.
# For AMD GPUs, install ROCm wheels, or set up a Docker container (provides torch/torchvision/torchaudio).
# pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
