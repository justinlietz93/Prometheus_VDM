## Generated Summary

The "fum_derivation_nblm" project, generated on 2025-08-26, presents a comprehensive overview of the "Fully Unified Model" (FUM) or "Void Dynamics (VDM)," detailing its theoretical framework, mathematical derivations, computational proofs, and validation methodologies across diverse physical and conceptual domains. The entire repository comprises 78 files, totaling 619,701 bytes and 13,265 lines of code.

The FUM's foundational physics is modeled in two layers, stemming from core discrete dynamics governed by `ΔW_i/Δt ≈ (α - β)W_i - αW_i^2`. The **Reaction-Diffusion (RD) branch**, which is `[PROVEN]` and established as the canonical leading-order continuum model, maps the discrete on-site dynamics `dW_i/dt = (α - β)W_i - α W_i^2 + J Σ(W_j - W_i)` to the continuum PDE `∂_t φ = D∇²φ + rφ - uφ²`. Key mappings include `D = Ja²` (or `(J/z)a²`), `r = α - β`, and `u = α`. The homogeneous fixed points are `φ=0` (dynamically unstable for `r>0`) and `φ*=r/u = 1 - β/α`. The more rigorous **Effective Field Theory (EFT)/Klein-Gordon (KG) branch**, currently `[PLAUSIBLE]` and quarantined for future work (as of 2025-08-20), yields second-order time dynamics `□φ + V'(φ) = 0` (or `∂t²φ - c²∇²φ + V'(φ) = 0`). This arises from a variational derivation using a discrete lattice Lagrangian, where `c² = κa²` (or `2Ja²` per-site) acts as a kinetic normalization constant `Z(φ)=½`. The potential `V(φ)` is derived from the on-site law, with a bounded baseline EFT incorporating a `λφ⁴` term: `V(φ) = -½μ²φ² + (λ/4)φ⁴` (with `μ² > 0, λ > 0`) and a small cubic tilt `(γ/3)φ³` to select a unique vacuum (`μ² ↔ α-β`, `γ ↔ α`). The effective mass `m_eff` is parameter-dependent (`√(α-β)` or `m_eff² = 2μ²`), not a fixed universal constant, and is unitized via `τ`. The EFT framework is further refined by incorporating a `φ⁴` chameleon screening term and a units-rigorous FUM-Voxtrium mapping that dimensionalizes FUM parameters (`φ_0`, `τ`, `a`) to GeV units, linking physical couplings (`g_3`, `m²`) to Voxtrium's coefficients. It also introduces a causal, retarded kernel for continuum coupling and embeds the FUM scalar EFT into an action-level framework with General Relativity (GR) and a horizon functional `S_hor` for covariant conservation, linking `φ` to Voxtrium's dimensionless inputs (`z`) and partitions (`p_i`).

The VDM theory posits universal physical constants derived from FUM AI learning stability requirements, suggesting a profound link between cognitive and physical constants. These include `ALPHA = 0.25` (learning rate), `BETA = 0.1` (structural plasticity rate), `F_REF = 0.02` (time modulation frequency), and `PHASE_SENS = 0.5`. It also defines "universal dimensionless groups" such as Void Debt Number `𝔇`, Emergent Coupling Ratio `Ξ`, Inverse-Scaling Exponent `α`, Void Mach Number `M_v`, Topological Information Ratio `Θ`, Symmetry Debt Ratio `Σ`, and Dispersion-to-Convergence Ratio `Λ`, which are critical for characterizing system behavior and determining stability, divergence, or self-organization across diverse domains. A "Void Debt Modulation" system calculates domain-specific scaling factors using `modulation = 1.0 + (sparsity_fraction^2) / (β/α)`, which yields target sparsity percentages for Quantum (15%), Standard Model (22%), Dark Matter (27%), Biology/Consciousness (20%), Cosmogenesis (84%), and Higgs (80%), asserting these values emerge from universal learning stability rather than arbitrary physical assumptions.

While a naive time-independent Hamiltonian is not conserved for the FUM's first-order dissipative flow, a rigorous **symmetry analysis** identified time-translation invariance in the on-site dynamical law `dW/dt = (α - β)W - αW²`. Applying Noether's Theorem, an exact logarithmic **constant of motion, `Q_FUM = t - (1/(α-β))ln|W(t)/((α-β) - αW(t))|`**, was derived. This `Q_FUM` is constant along any single-site trajectory and has been numerically verified to machine precision, resolving a core theoretical critique about the model's conservation laws. The `Q_FUM` logistic invariant is used in computational checks (`check_site_constant_of_motion`, `qfum_logistic_value`, `check_qfum_logistic`) to ensure deterministic behavior.

The FUM framework is shown to admit a **Navier-Stokes (NS) regime** through two approaches: an operational reduction via Kinetic/Lattice-Boltzmann (LBM) using a D2Q9 BGK model and Chapman-Enskog expansion, explicitly yielding kinematic viscosity `ν = c_s²(τ_c - ½Δt)`; and a structural reduction from conserved fields imposing Galilean invariance, spatial isotropy, and local balances, recovering NS with `ν = η/ρ₀`. Validation includes **Taylor-Green vortex** (2D periodic) benchmarks, requiring viscous decay `E(t) = E0 exp(−2νk²t)` with a fitted viscosity `ν_fit` within 5% relative error of theoretical `ν_th` (on `≥ 256²` grids), and **Lid-driven cavity flow** (square) requiring the maximum divergence norm `‖∇·v‖₂` over time to be `≤ 1e-6`. A read-only observability layer, **Void-Walker Announcers**, provides passive causal measurements (divergence, swirl, shear) without altering the fluid solver; a falsifiable non-interference test (`test_walkers_noninterference.py`) ensures `max |Δu| = 0` and `|Δv| = 0`. This concept extends to **Void-announcers for neural networks**, where walkers sample network activations and gradients, emit "petitions" to build a "void debt" functional (`D_void`), and inform a bounded advisory policy to nudge numeric optimization parameters (e.g., `u_clamp`, `τ`) to reduce `D_void` without interfering with forward dynamics.

Memory steering operates as an orthogonal, slower layer designed to bias routing without altering core `φ` propagation. A "memory potential" `M(x,t)` defines a local refractive index `n(x,t) = exp[ηM(x,t)]`, leading to a **steering law** for ray curvature: `r'' = ∇_⊥ ln n = η∇_⊥ M`, where `η > 0` signifies attraction to increasing `M`. The dynamics of memory are governed by the PDE `∂tM = γR(x,t) - δM + κ∇²M`, encompassing local usage/co-activation (`R`), write gain (`γ`), decay rate (`δ`), and spatial consolidation (`κ`). Graph discretization is implemented using an unnormalized Laplacian for discrete updates and softmax transition probabilities `P(i→j) = exp(Θm_j) / Σ_k exp(Θm_k)`, which reduces to a logistic form `P(A) = σ(Θ Δm)` at a two-branch junction. Key dimensionless groups are `Θ = η M0`, `D_a = γ R0 T / M0`, `Λ = δ T`, and `Γ = κ T / L²`, which predict the junction choice law, path curvature scaling `κ_path ∝ Θ|∇_⊥m|`, and a stability band for robust memory retention (`D_a ≳ Λ`). An acceptance framework (implemented 2025-08-21) codifies criteria for `M` boundedness `[0,1]`, linear step response `|p_fit − p_pred| ≤ 0.02`, convergence to a canonical void target (`|M_final − 0.6| ≤ 0.02` for specific parameters), noise suppression (`ΔSNR_out−in ≥ 3 dB`), Lyapunov monotonicity, and reproducibility. The `MemoryField` (`memory/field.py`) serves as an event-driven, bounded, sparse-first memory structure that implements these dynamics, processing various events and providing snapshots.

An analysis of **finite-tube modes** within the FUM scalar Effective Field Theory aims to predict tachyonic (unstable) orbital modes in finite cylindrical domains, demonstrate quartic stabilization, and identify a true energy minimum. This involves a piecewise background model with an uncondensed/tachyonic state inside a tube of radius `R` and a condensed/massive state outside. Linearized fluctuations result in Bessel-type radial equations, whose matching conditions at `r=R` yield a **secular equation** for the transverse separation constant `κ`. Tachyonic modes correspond to `κ² > 0`, allowing for the counting of unstable modes `N_tach(R)` and the derivation of effective 2D mode reduction with quartic couplings. Post-condensation, a mass matrix `(M²)_(ℓn),(ℓ'n')` is expected to have non-negative eigenvalues, and the total energy `E(R)` (background plus effective potential) should exhibit a minimum at a specific radius `R_∗`. Computational pipelines (`cylinder_modes.py`, `condense_tube.py`) are outlined, with acceptance criteria including the observation of a tachyonic mode tower, post-condensation positivity, and an energy minimum.

The `CoreEngine` serves as the central runtime interface, initializing event-driven "reducer" maps (`_cold_map`, `_heat_map`, `_exc_map`, `_inh_map`, `_memory_map`, `_trail_map`) for telemetry and steering, exposing `_memory_map` as a read-only pointer to the connectome. It provides a concise API for connectome interaction, including `stimulate_indices` for injecting stimulus, `step_connectome` to advance state, `compute_metrics` for runtime statistics, and `snapshot_graph` for visualization. Numeric helper methods like `compute_active_edge_density`, `compute_td_signal`, and `compute_firing_var` offer introspection into core signals. State management is handled by `snapshot`, which creates a minimal state snapshot merging cached event-driven metrics, and `engram_load`/`engram_save` which support HDF5 (`.h5`) and NPZ (`.npz`) formats, optionally including Active Domain Cartography (ADC) state. The `Orchestrator` acts as a facade over the underlying `Nexus` instance, delegating its `run` method directly and providing `step`, `snapshot`, `read_bus`, and `engram_load`/`engram_save` methods that pass through to `CoreEngine` helpers. Checkpointing functionality periodically saves state (`.h5` or `.npz`) and prunes older checkpoints based on a configurable `checkpoint_keep` parameter.

Event-driven telemetry is central, with figures and logs consistently routed to UTC timestamped filenames within `derivation/code/outputs/figures/` and `derivation/code/outputs/logs/`, respectively. The system emphasizes reproducible CLI arguments, JSON logging with `metrics.passed` flags, and strict CI hygiene. The `build_evt_snapshot` function aggregates lightweight telemetry from various `EventDrivenMetrics` instances and specialized reducer maps, while `stage_maps_frame` prepares Float32 arrays for map visualizations. Core performance indicators (KPIs) like `avg_weight`, `active_synapses`, `cohesion_components`, `complexity_cycles`, and `connectome_entropy` are computed by `metrics.py`, and `StreamingZEMA` detects "spikes" in these metrics. Event types (e.g., `DeltaEvent`, `VTTouchEvent`, `SpikeEvent`, `DeltaWEvent`) and incremental reducers (`StreamingMeanVar`, `EWMA`, `CountMinSketchHead`, `UnionFindCohesion`) are defined for `EventDrivenMetrics` to fold events and provide snapshots. A stable API (`signals.py`) derives core numeric signals, prioritizing cached values or recomputation. Runtime emitters (`MacroEmitter`, `ThoughtEmitter`) log structured data, and an `events_adapter` maps connectome `Observation` objects to event-driven metrics events for deterministic, bounded generation. Status updates and macros are emitted to Unified Telemetry Data (UTD) and can be published to Redis Streams or served via an in-process HTTP server. The `models/series.py` module defines `SeriesState` as a rolling buffer for dashboard timeseries, including `tick`, `active_synapses`, `avg_weight`, `cohesion_components`, `complexity_cycles`, `b1_z`, `SIE_valence`, and `connectome_entropy`, with `StreamingZEMA` for z-score calculations that match legacy dashboard behavior.

The `SelfImprovementEngine` (SIE) functions as the FUM's intrinsic motivation system, generating a multi-objective valence signal by tracking `td_error`, `novelty`, `habituation` (per-neuron), and `self_benefit`. It can update valence using a sparse matrix or from runtime density metrics. The `get_drive` method computes a canonical Rule 3 drive packet, incorporating a Homeostatic Stability Index (HSI) derived from firing variance, an intrinsic TD signal from density change, and novelty scaled by rarity. A newer, void-faithful `sie_v2.py` implements a per-tick intrinsic drive directly from `W` and `dW`, calculating per-neuron reward and a smooth scalar valence based on weighted and clipped `novelty_norm` (from `|dW|`), `_hsi_norm` (from `|dW|` mean/variance), and a TD signal from `W` change.

Neuroplasticity within the FUM is managed by several interconnected modules. The `GrowthArbiter` monitors rolling metrics (e.g., `avg_weight`, `active_synapses`, `complexity_cycles`, `cohesion_components`) over a `stability_window`. When stable, it accumulates "void debt" based on a `valence_signal`; if this debt exceeds a threshold, it triggers network growth (`grow` neurons) via `Neurogenesis`, which expands the connectome with new neurons and initial connections using `universal_void_dynamics`. If unstable, it proposes culling proportional to valence. `Goal-Directed Structural Plasticity (GDSP)` (`GDSPActuator`) orchestrates these actions, including homeostatic repairs (`_grow_connection_across_gap` to bridge topological gaps, `_prune_connections_in_locus`) and performance-driven growth, triggered by sustained high reward/TD error and novelty. `Structural Homeostasis` (Blueprint Rule 4/4.1) further ensures topological health by pruning weak edges (below an adaptive threshold, typically 10% of mean weight) and healing fragmented components by adding symmetric bridge edges selected by maximizing a void-affinity matrix `S_ij`. `Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (RE-VGSP)` (`RevGSP` learner) handles synaptic weight updates using an STDP-like impulse modulated by phase and latency, a reward-separated learning rate (`_eta_effective`), and eligibility trace decay gated by `_gamma_from_plv`. Its `adapt` method applies a three-factor learning rule based on eligibility traces, learning rate, and decay to adjust `W`. The `SparseConnectome`'s `step` method orchestrates these delta calculations, structural maintenance (adaptive pruning and budgeted cohesion bridging), node field updates (`W` gated by SIE valence), and SIE v2 intrinsic reward calculation. The `Substrate` class (Version 4) represents the FUM's computational medium, supporting CPU/GPU, neuron dynamics, intrinsic plasticity, and synaptic scaling.

Global system components include `Active Domain Cartography (ADC)`, which dynamically maps neurons to "territories" by applying 1D k-means clustering over the node field `W`, with adaptive scheduling and reactive adaptation based on connectome entropy and cohesion scores. The `Disjoint Set Union (DSU)` class provides an efficient, path-compressed, union-by-rank data structure for O(1) component counting. Building upon this, the `TerritoryUF` class maintains a Union-Find structure over `edge_on`-like events to approximate connected components or "cohesion territories," storing a bounded head of member indices per component root, enabling efficient sampling for actuators like GDSP without global graph scans. The `VoidB1Meter` provides a streaming surrogate for Betti-1 (cyclic structure) and Euler-rank estimates, leveraging EMA smoothing, a reservoir sampler for bounded active edge sampling, and efficient triangle counting to compute network topology metrics and produce a normalized `void_b1` scalar.

Several speculative experimental scripts serve as "Computational Toy Proofs" demonstrating the emergence of fundamental physics from universal void dynamics, leveraging the `ALPHA` and `BETA` constants and domain-specific modulation factors. These include `FUM_BC` (simulating multi-scale consciousness emergence with a 20% sparsity target), `FUM_Cosmogenesis` (modeling the universe's origin via "Inherited Cosmic Debt" of 0.84, predicting high sparsity), `FUM_DM` (reproducing cosmological dark matter density with a 27% sparsity target), `FUM_Einsteins_Field_Equations` (symbolically deriving the emergence of Einstein's Field Equations with falsifiable criteria), `FUM_HB` (demonstrating Higgs field evolution and mass generation through symmetry breaking, targeting 80% sparsity, with Higgs mass prediction via direct scaling with a 25% error threshold), `FUM_Light_Speed` (deriving the universal speed of light from electromagnetic void dynamics), `FUM_QM` (exploring wave-particle duality and quantum void states with a 15% sparsity target), and `FUM_SM` (investigating gauge force unification and particle interactions with a 22% sparsity target).

A robust testing and validation framework is in place. **Reaction-Diffusion (RD) Canonical Validations** include the **Front-speed (Fisher-KPP)**, where the theoretical speed `c_front = 2√(Dr)` was `[PROVEN]` with a measured `c_meas ≈ 0.953` versus a theoretical `c_th = 1.0` (relative error `≈ 0.047`, `R² ≈ 0.999996`), meeting acceptance criteria (relative error `≤ 0.05`, `R² ≥ 0.98`), and **Linear Dispersion**, where the theoretical dispersion `σ(k) = r - Dk²` was `[PROVEN]` via linearized periodic evolution (median relative error `≈ 1.45 × 10^-3`, `R²_array ≈ 0.99995`), meeting criteria (median relative error `≤ 0.10`, `R²_array ≥ 0.98`). The **Q_FUM Logistic Invariant**, a logarithmic first integral `Q(W,t) = ln(W/(r - u W)) - r t` for the autonomous on-site logistic ODE, was also `[PROVEN]` numerically, requiring `ΔQ ≤ 10^-8` and convergence consistent with the time-stepper's order. **Lattice Boltzmann (LBM) Tests** include unit tests for streaming/solid boundaries and functional tests for Taylor-Green vortex, Lid-driven cavity, and non-interference of read-only walkers. **Memory Steering Tests** validate fixed-point linear convergence, boundedness `[0,1]`, reproducibility, and convergence to a canonical void target (`M* = 0.6`). A **Gravity Regression Pack** verifies GR-like perihelion precession (non-zero, consistent sign, low coefficient of variation) and connectome sanity checks. The **VDM Corner Testbed** evaluates Void-Debt Modulation (VDM) regularized dynamics in a 2D L-bend setup. An aggregated "Physics Validation Task" is proposed for Continuous Integration (CI) to run all physics tests, check `passed==True` status, and detect tachyonic roots.

The core runtime execution is driven by the `run_loop` in `loop/main.py`, which mirrors the `Nexus` while-loop, orchestrating per-tick processing. This includes: lazy initialization of the `CoreEngine`, various scouts, `EventDrivenMetrics` aggregator, Maps WebSocket, and HTTP status endpoint; ingestion of incoming UTE messages to update lexicon and n-grams, extract stimulation indices, and apply stimuli; polling `phase.json` for dynamic configuration updates; calculating elapsed time and essential metrics like `active_edge_density`, TD-like signal, firing variability, and SIE drive before advancing the connectome's state; conditionally running `RevGSP` (online learner) and `GDSP` (structural actuator); folding event-driven telemetry from the bus, updating ADC, `TerritoryUF`, and applying the B1 detector; attaching contextual information and metrics; and performing housekeeping tasks such as smoke tests, periodically saving the lexicon, autonomous speaking, logging structured tick data, emitting status/macros, publishing to Redis Streams, and saving/pruning checkpoints. `stepper.py` specifically details `compute_step_and_metrics`, which computes key signals and advances the connectome. Runtime phase control is managed by `phase.py`, defining `default_phase_profiles` to apply merged configuration settings (including SIE, structure, and cadence knobs) from `phase.json`, allowing for one-shot engram loading upon updates. `retention.py` provides `prune_checkpoints` to enforce rolling checkpoint retention, while `state.py` defines `RuntimeRing` (a bounded deque for small signals) and `RuntimeState` as lightweight context containers tracking `seed`, `tick`, `t0`, and other runtime statistics, ensuring a deterministic `random.Random` instance per tick.

The frontend provides essential utilities for file system interaction, robust JSON data handling, best-effort PDF-to-text conversion, centralized FUM runtime profile management, and efficient log tailing of JSONL files by byte offset. A minimal Dash-based `debug_ui.py` offers diagnostics, displaying file and directory statistics, run-directory selection, and charts for log file sizes over time. Visualization tools include `void_driven_layout` for computing organic 2D/3D connectome layouts, `plot_network_graph` (2D Matplotlib) and `plot_3d_network_graph` (interactive Plotly) for rendering connectomes with node/edge properties, `plot_spike_raster` for spike trains, and `create_maze_animation`. It also supports exporting connectome data to `FUM.connectome.v1` JSON schema or NPZ format. Frontend services include `process_manager.py` for managing the external `fum_rt.run_nexus` process, robustly detecting run directories and configuring `PYTHONPATH`, and `status_client.py` for a lightweight HTTP client to fetch runtime status snapshots. A modular CSS system (`styles` package) ensures consistent Dash UI styling with separation of concerns. The `Visualizer` class generates runtime dashboards showing sparsity, average synaptic weight, cohesion, and complexity, capable of rendering the `Foundational UKG Structure` graph.

The research outlook is focused on discovering the true conserved quantities of the FUM, exploring advanced **Symmetry Analysis (Noether's Theorem)** for more complex symmetries, **Lyapunov Function Analysis** for dissipative systems, or **Information-Theoretic Quantities** (e.g., Shannon Entropy, Topological Invariants), particularly given the FUM's origins in cognitive science.
