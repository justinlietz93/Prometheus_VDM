# The Self-Improvement Engine

### Continuous Reinforcement Learning: Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) with TD Learning

For any intelligent system to move beyond simple, pre-programmed behaviors, it must possess an internal compass—a mechanism to determine whether its actions are 'good' or 'bad' in relation to a broader goal. This internal arbitration of success and failure is the foundation of true learning. The Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) is the FUM's implementation of such a compass. It generates a dynamic, internal reward signal that guides the system's vast network of connections, enabling it to learn, adapt, and refine its functions through its own 'experience'. The core challenge in learning from experience is translating a sequence of actions into a coherent judgment of success or failure. An action taken now might have consequences far in the future, yet the system must learn to connect them. This is the classic problem of 'credit assignment'. The FUM addresses this through a form of continuous reinforcement learning, where an internal reward signal is constantly generated and refined. This signal, a blend of performance, novelty, and stability, provides the ongoing feedback necessary to assign credit and blame, allowing the system to learn from the delayed consequences of its actions.

**A.1. Purpose & Contrast with Supervised Learning**

*   **Detail:** The Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) provides a sparse, global feedback signal, `total_reward`, to guide the local **Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (RE-VGSP)** process. Unlike supervised learning, which requires detailed labels for every input, the SIE uses a reward signal derived from task success, internal consistency, and novelty. This enables the network to learn from trial-and-error towards desired high-level outcomes with minimal explicit supervision, allowing FUM to learn complex tasks where detailed labels are unavailable or impractical to obtain.

***Section B.***

**B.1. Reward Signal (`total_reward`) & Component Calculation**

*   **The Reward Formula:** The `total_reward` signal is the primary output of the SIE. It is a composite score that synthesizes multiple streams of information into a single scalar value. The canonical formula is a weighted sum of normalized components:
    ```
    total_reward = w_td * TD_error_norm + w_nov * novelty_norm - w_hab * habituation_norm + w_hsi * hsi_norm
    ```
*   **Normalization:** All `_norm` components must be normalized (e.g., to a range of `[-1, 1]`) before being combined.
*   **Weights:** The `w_*` components are scalar weights that balance the influence of each of the SIE's intrinsic drives.

[DIAGRAM: A central node labeled "SIE" with four input arrows labeled "TD Error", "Novelty", "Habituation", and "HSI". One output arrow is labeled "Total Reward Signal to RE-VGSP".]

*   **Component Descriptions:** Each component of the `total_reward` formula corresponds to one of the system's intrinsic drives, creating a balanced and comprehensive guidance signal:
    *   **`TD_error_norm` (Task Success):** This component is derived from Temporal Difference learning. It measures the difference between the expected future reward and the actual reward received, pushing the system to improve its performance on explicit goals. It is calculated as `R_t + γ * V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)`, where `V(S)` is the predicted value of being in a given network state (cluster).
    *   **`novelty_norm` (Exploration & Curiosity):** This component encourages the system to explore new internal states and patterns. It is calculated based on the visitation count (`N(S)`) of the network's emergent territories, rewarding the system for activating less-frequented pathways.
    *   **`habituation_norm` (Generalization & Efficiency):** This component prevents the system from getting stuck on familiar patterns. It is measured by the cosine similarity between the current input and a time-averaged representation of recent inputs, penalizing redundant processing and promoting generalization.
    *   **`hsi_norm` (Homeostatic Stability Index):** This component ensures the network remains in a stable, efficient operating regime. It is calculated based on the deviation from a target firing rate variance (`1 - |var(firing_rates) - target_var| / target_var`), rewarding stable, brain-like activity.

***Section C.***

**C.1. TD Learning Specifics (TD(0), Value Function)**

*   **The TD(0) Algorithm:** The SIE uses the TD(0) algorithm for its simplicity and effectiveness. The core of this is the **TD Error**, which is the difference between the actual reward received and the reward that was predicted.
    ```
    TD_error = r + γ * V(next_state) - V(current_state)
    ```
    *   `r`: Immediate external reward (+1 for correct, -1 for incorrect, 0 for neutral) if available.
    *   `γ`: A discount factor (e.g., 0.9) that determines the importance of future rewards.
*   **The Value Function `V(state)`:** The Value Function, `V(state)`, predicts the expected future cumulative reward from a given state. A key innovation in FUM is how it defines a "state." Instead of using the entire network's activity, a state corresponds to the ID of the currently active **cluster**, as determined by active cartography. This approach dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the state space, making the value function tractable. This simplification is effective because the cluster ID serves as a strong **Markov property approximation**, meaning the next state is highly dependent on the current active cluster. The value function itself is represented as a tensor, `V_states`, and is updated after each step using the calculated TD error.

***Section D.***

**D.1. The Exploration-Exploitation Balance: Novelty and Habituation**

*   **Novelty:** To encourage exploration, the SIE calculates a `novelty` score. It maintains a buffer of recent input patterns and computes the cosine similarity between the current input and this history. A low similarity results in a high novelty score, rewarding the processing of new information.
*   **Habituation:** To prevent overfitting and complement novelty, the SIE also calculates a `habituation` score. If an input is too similar to patterns in the recent history, a counter for that pattern is incremented. This counter value, which decays over time, directly penalizes the total reward, discouraging the system from getting stuck on familiar inputs.

***Section E.***

**E.1. The Homeostatic Stability Index (HSI)**

*   **Concept:** The HSI is a critical, configurable mechanism for promoting overall network stability. It allows for a direct trade-off between computational cost and the precision of the stability measurement.

*   **Mode 1: Behavioral Homeostasis (Formal):** This mode provides the most robust and direct measure of network stability. It directly promotes behavioral homeostasis by calculating the variance of neural firing rates and rewarding the network for keeping this variance near a target value. As this requires iterating over all neurons, its computational cost is linear, `O(N)`.
    ```
    HSI = 1 - |torch.var(spike_rates) - target_var| / target_var
    ```
*   **Canonical HSI:** The formal, behavioral calculation of HSI is the only canonical method. Deprecated proxies such as `self_benefit` or those based on structural sparsity are not part of the blueprint.
*   **Configuration and Interaction:** The configurable nature of the HSI is crucial for research and development, allowing for direct benchmarking of the two modes and providing valuable data on the trade-off between computational cost and the quality of the stability signal. The HSI is designed to interact intelligently with other reward components. For instance, high novelty might temporarily reduce the HSI score, but the system learns to balance the drive for exploration with the need for stable operation. Ultimately, a stable network state is necessary for the TD learning value function to converge reliably.

***Section F.***

**F.1. Influence on Learning (Modulation)**

*   **The Modulation Mechanism:** The `total_reward` signal directly gates the learning event as the final step in the three-factor RE-VGSP rule. The `total_reward` signal is used to calculate the `Reinforcement` term in the canonical RE-VGSP formula. A positive `total_reward` results in a positive reinforcement, while a negative `total_reward` results in a punishment (negative reinforcement). This mechanism is combined with the resonance-modulated eligibility trace (`e_ij`) and a stabilizing decay (`lambda_decay`) to produce the final weight change.
    ```
    Reinforcement = eta_effective(total_reward) * e_ij(t)
    Decay = lambda_decay * w_ij
    Δw_ij = Reinforcement - Decay
    ```
*   **Function:** This ensures that local synaptic changes are always guided by the global strategic goals of the system.
*   **Interaction Robustness:** The interaction between the global SIE reward and local VGSP plasticity is designed for robustness. **Temporal decoupling** prevents unstable feedback loops, as the SIE calculates its reward over a longer window than the Eligibility Trace (`e_ij`). **Modular reward application**, mediated by the synapse-specific eligibility trace, ensures credit is assigned only to recently active synapses. The **HSI** provides homeostatic regulation, while the **integrated reward balancing** of the SIE as a whole ensures the signal provides coherent, not contradictory, guidance.

***Section G.***

**G.1. Goal & Alignment Concerns**

*   **Driving Self-Organization:** The ultimate goal of the SIE is to drive the network's self-organization process (both RE-VGSP and GDSP). It pushes the system to find internal configurations that maximize the cumulative `total_reward` signal over time, thereby improving performance, stability, and novelty.
*   **Reliability and Goal Alignment:** A complex `total_reward` function must be robust against conflicting objectives and prevent the system from "gaming the system." The SIE's components are designed to be in alignment: external reward drives accuracy, TD error promotes long-term success, novelty ensures adaptability, habituation prevents overfitting, and the HSI enforces efficiency. The system manages conflicts between these objectives using a **multi-objective framework** that balances the components. For example, the conflict between exploration (which increases activity variance) and stability-seeking (which reduces it) is actively managed by scaling the influence of each component based on the current context. To prevent oscillations and suboptimal policies, the system uses **damped adjustments** and **reward normalization**.
*   **Reward Hacking:** A key challenge is the risk of the system learning to optimize for the internal intricacies of the SIE rather than mastering external tasks. This is mitigated through a variety of **safeguards**. These include capping and normalizing reward components, regularizing the value function to prevent unbounded growth, and periodically injecting "ground truth" data to anchor the internal reward signal to external reality. Further safeguards include monitoring for behavioral diversity and enforcing energy efficiency constraints. The system can even be subjected to **adversarial testing** to explicitly probe for and patch vulnerabilities to reward gaming.
*   **Formal Guarantees for Correctness:** Formal guarantees for the SIE's correctness are pursued through several avenues. Its alignment with established **reinforcement learning theory** provides a solid theoretical foundation. A specific **correctness metric** can be computed by comparing the internal `total_reward` to the external `r` over time. To ensure credit is assigned correctly, a **refined causal inference** approach based on interventions can be used to prevent reward hacking from spurious correlations. Finally, **sensitivity analysis** of the SIE component weights ensures that the system's alignment is not overly dependent on any single parameter.

***Section H.***

**H.1. Dynamic Ethics Adjuster**

*   **Mechanism and Rationale:** As a final, critical safeguard, the SIE includes a Dynamic Ethics Adjuster. This mechanism ensures the FUM's autonomous behavior remains aligned with predefined ethical constraints as it learns and adapts. It monitors network outputs for patterns that could violate encoded ethical principles (e.g., "avoid harmful outputs"). If a potential violation is detected, the adjuster dynamically applies a strong negative `ethical_penalty` to the `total_reward`, guiding the learning process away from developing unethical behaviors. The effectiveness of this adjuster is measured by specific alignment metrics during validation, with the goal of demonstrating a high alignment rate at scale. This provides a more nuanced and adaptive approach to ethical alignment than static rules alone.
