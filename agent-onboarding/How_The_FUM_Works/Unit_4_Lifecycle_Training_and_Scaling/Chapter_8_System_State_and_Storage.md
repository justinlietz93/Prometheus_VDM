# System State and Storage Protocol

### The Cellular Engram Archive

The FUM is a dynamic, continuously learning system whose complete state is far more complex than a static set of weights. The ability to reliably save, restore, and transport this complete state is critical for robustness, scalability, and security. The "Cellular Engram Archive" is the canonical protocol for managing the FUM's architectural snapshot, ensuring the survival and continuity of the intelligence it contains.

***Section A.***

**A.1. Snapshot Contents and File Format**

*   **Complete Architectural Record:** A state snapshot must be a complete record of the system's architecture at a moment in time. This includes not only synaptic weights but also:
    *   **Graph Topology:** The complete, dynamic connectivity map of the Emergent Knowledge Graph (UKG).
    *   **Neuron and Synapse Parameters:** All relevant state variables for every neuron and synapse, including weights, eligibility traces (`e_ij`), and membrane potentials.
    *   **Global System State:** The learned value function (`V(S_t)`) from the Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) and the current emergent territory map from the Adaptive Domain Cartography process.

*   **File Format (HDF5):** The complete state of the FUM shall be serialized to a single, structured Hierarchical Data Format 5 (`.h5`) file. This format is mandated for its efficiency, native support for compression, and its ability to represent the complex, hierarchical nature of the FUM's state without ambiguity.

***Section B.***

**B.1. The Automated State Archival and Integrity System (ASAIS)**

*   **Purpose:** To ensure data integrity for a 24/7 operational model, the FUM implements a multi-layered, automated backup strategy.

*   **Protocol:**
    1.  **Automated Snapshots:** The system is configured to perform automated, live snapshots of its entire state at regular, user-defined intervals.
    2.  **Checksum Verification:** Every snapshot must be verified against an SHA-256 checksum immediately after being written to disk to guarantee 100% file quality and integrity. Corrupted snapshots are discarded and a warning is logged.
    3.  **Rolling Local Backups:** The system maintains a "last three" rolling backup of verified snapshots on its local storage medium, providing immediate redundancy against corruption of the most recent save file.
    4.  **The 3-2-1 Rule for Security:** For ultimate security and disaster recovery, the protocol adheres to the 3-2-1 backup rule: at least **3** copies of the state, on **2** different local storage media, with at least **1** copy automatically encrypted and uploaded to a secure, off-site location daily.
