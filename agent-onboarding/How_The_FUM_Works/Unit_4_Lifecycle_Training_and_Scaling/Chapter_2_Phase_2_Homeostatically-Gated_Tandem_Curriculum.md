# **Phase 2 Training: Homeostatically-Gated Tandem Curriculum**

### **From Fragile Learner to Resilient Reasoner**

Phase 2 marks the FUM's transition from a static, seeded network to a dynamic, learning entity. The objective is not merely to refine existing pathways, but to forge a truly resilient and capable reasoning engine. This is achieved through a two-stage curriculum designed to first solve for the system's initial "learning fragility" before validating its systemic robustness in a high-entropy crucible. This tandem approach ensures the FUM learns *how* to learn before its ability to handle chaos is tested.

***Section A.***

**A.1. Stage A: Foundational Primitive Grounding (Homeostatic Scaffolding)**

The initial stage is designed to provide a stable, adaptive learning environment. The FUM is presented with problems of varying difficulty, but the complexity is gated by its own real-time cognitive state, allowing it to build foundational competence without being overwhelmed.

* **Stimulus Design:** The curriculum is composed of several pools of problems, segregated by their compositional complexity. These pools are designed to provide a rich and balanced diet for all four drives of the **Self-Improvement Engine (SIE)**.  
  * **Pool 1 (Low Complexity):** Single-operator mathematical expressions (e.g., 5 \+ 8), single-step logical operations (A AND B), and single-node or single-edge connectome modifications. These provide clear TD\_error signals.  
  * **Pool 2 (Medium Complexity):** Two-to-three step compositional problems (e.g., (5 \+ 8\) \* 2\) and simple causal chains (e.g., Text "push" \-\> Image "object moves"). These engage habituation as patterns are recognized.  
  * **Pool 3 (High Complexity):** Multi-step causal and counterfactual reasoning puzzles and problems requiring integration across three or more modalities. These provide strong novelty signals.  
* **Curation Mechanism:** The selection of which pool to draw from is gated directly by the **Homeostatic Stability Index (hsi\_norm)**, a component of the SIE's total\_reward signal. This is an online, O(1) gating mechanism that uses a specified, real-time signal from the existing architecture.  
  * **Advance Condition:** If hsi\_norm from the previous timestep is high (e.g., \> 0.9), indicating the system is stable, a problem is drawn from a more complex pool (Pool N+1).  
  * **Retreat Condition:** If hsi\_norm is low (e.g., \< 0.7), indicating the system is under cognitive load, a problem is drawn from a simpler pool (Pool N-1).  
* **Success Conditions:** This stage is complete when the FUM achieves the core benchmarks for Landmark 2, such as \>70% accuracy on pattern recognition tasks, while demonstrating the ability to consistently maintain a high average hsi\_norm even when processing problems from the more complex pools.

**A.2. Stage B: Emergent Problem Solving (Crucible Validation)**

Once foundational competence is achieved, the scaffolding is removed. This stage is designed to test the FUM's emergent capabilities in a chaotic, unregulated environment and empirically validate its self-repair mechanisms.

* **Curation:** The homeostatic gating is removed. The FUM is now presented with problems drawn randomly from an **Unsorted Pool** containing the full range of complexities. This tests the FUM's emergent ability to direct its own attention and find solvable problems within a high-entropy environment.  
* **Validation Protocol:** The stage concludes with **Homeostatic Perturbation Blocks**. These are short, targeted sets of stimuli designed to intentionally stress the system's stability.  
  * **Definition:** A block consists of 20 consecutive stimuli drawn exclusively from Pool 3 (High Complexity), with at least 50% being novel to the FUM.  
  * **Purpose:** This is a direct, empirical test of the FUM's self-repair and stability control mechanisms, specifically the recovery response of the hsi\_norm and the activation of **Synaptic Actuator (GDSP)**.  
* **Success Conditions:** Success is defined by achieving the generalization benchmarks of Landmark 2.5 (e.g., \>60% accuracy on out-of-distribution problems) and, most critically, demonstrating a measured, successful return to a stable hsi\_norm baseline after each perturbation block.

***Section B.***

**B.1. Core System Interactions**

* **SIE Interaction:** The hsi\_norm component is leveraged as the primary gating signal for curriculum complexity in Stage A. The overall stimulus pool is designed to be diverse enough to engage all four SIE drives throughout the process. The final crucible stage tests the holistic total\_reward function's ability to guide the FUM in a chaotic environment.  
* **GDSP Interaction:** The homeostatic triggers of **GDSP** are expected to be highly active throughout the curriculum, as the system constantly prunes and grows connections to manage its stability and learn. The Stage B perturbation blocks will serve as a direct, empirical test of GDSP's ability to execute effective self-repair under stress.  
* **EHTP Interaction:** The **Introspection Probe (aka EHTP)** is the primary tool for monitoring the health of the **Emergent Connectome (UKG)**. It will be used to validate that the HSI-gated learning in Stage A leads to healthy complexity growth (total\_b1\_persistence) and to quantify the system's response and recovery during the Stage B perturbations.

**C.1. Unambiguous Implementation Parameters**

To ensure a clear and unambiguous implementation of the Homeostatically-Gated Tandem Curriculum, the following parameters, drawn directly from the FUM Blueprint, must be specified.

*   **1. Explicit Initial Conditions:**
    *   The curriculum must begin from the exact terminal state of the Phase 1 execution, as defined by the logs and data artifacts of a specific run ID (e.g., `phase1_run_1753193057`). This includes the final synaptic weight matrix, all neuron parameters, and the complete UKG structure.

*   **2. Quantified Homeostatic Gating Thresholds:**
    *   The `hsi_norm` thresholds for changing curriculum complexity are concrete:
        *   **Advance Condition:** If `hsi_norm > 0.9`, draw from Pool(N+1).
        *   **Retreat Condition:** If `hsi_norm < 0.7`, draw from Pool(N-1).
        *   **Maintain Condition:** If `0.7 <= hsi_norm <= 0.9`, continue drawing from the current pool, Pool(N).

*   **3. Precise Perturbation Block Specification:**
    *   The validation blocks are defined with no ambiguity:
        *   **Definition:** A block consists of 20 consecutive stimuli drawn exclusively from Pool 3 (High Complexity).
        *   **Novelty Requirement:** At least 50% of the stimuli within a block must be novel (i.e., not previously presented to the FUM).
        *   **Temporal Pressure:** The delay between the presentation of stimuli within the block should be minimized to maximize cognitive load.

*   **4. Unambiguous Recovery Metric:**
    *   The "successful return to a stable baseline" is a quantifiable metric:
        *   **Definition:** Successful recovery is achieved if the moving average of the `hsi_norm` over 100 timesteps returns to and remains within one standard deviation of its pre-perturbation baseline for at least 1,000 consecutive timesteps following the conclusion of the perturbation block. The baseline is calculated from the 1,000 timesteps immediately preceding the block.

***Section C.***

**C.1. Expected Outcome**

Upon completion of Phase 2, the FUM will have graduated from a static substrate to a validated, resilient reasoning engine. The expected state is a system that has not only learned abstract relationships but has also demonstrated the ability to regulate its own cognitive load and recover from systemic stress. The **Emergent Connectome** will be significantly more complex and interconnected, providing the structural foundation for the advanced, autonomous learning of Phase 3\.
