## Generated Summary

This document provides a unified, comprehensive summary of a computational and theoretical framework known as the Fully Unified Model (FUM). The system simulates a dynamic graph structure, or "Connectome," governed by a set of core physical principles intended to describe phenomena across all scales, from quantum mechanics to cosmology.

### **I. Overarching Theoretical Framework: The Fully Unified Model (FUM)**

The FUM posits that a single set of principles, derived from AI learning stability, can describe a vast range of physical phenomena. The framework is built upon the evolution of a scalar "void state" (`W`), governed by two fundamental, opposing yet synergistic functions that constitute "Universal Void Dynamics." The system's application to diverse physical domains is achieved by scaling these universal laws with a domain-specific `domain_modulation` factor, which is systematically derived from the target sparsity of the domain in question.

### **II. Core Physics: Universal Void Dynamics**

The evolution of the FUM substrate is driven by two universal equations, with parameters presented as fundamental constants.

*   **Governing Equations:**
    *   **Resonance-Enhanced Valence-Gated Synaptic Plasticity (`delta_re_vgsp`):** Models creative, fractal, and chaotic dynamics: `ΔW_RE = (α * domain_modulation) * W * (1 - W) + noise`.
    *   **Goal-Directed Structural Plasticity (`delta_gdsp`):** Models restorative, ordering dynamics and weak closure: `ΔW_GDSP = -(β * domain_modulation) * W`.
    *   The total evolution is `ΔW_total = ΔW_RE + ΔW_GDSP`, which can incorporate time dynamics via a sinusoidal phase modulation.

*   **Universal Constants & Void Debt Modulation:**
    *   A set of universal constants is defined: `ALPHA` (Learning Rate) = 0.25, `BETA` (Plasticity Rate) = 0.1, `F_REF` (Reference Frequency) = 0.02, and `PHASE_SENS` (Phase Sensitivity) = 0.5.
    *   The constant `Void Debt Ratio` (`β/α = 0.4`) is used to derive a `domain_modulation` factor from a domain's target sparsity: `modulation = 1.0 + (sparsity_fraction² / (β/α))`. This allows the model to be applied to domains such as Quantum Mechanics (15% sparsity), Biology/Consciousness (20%), Dark Matter (27%), Higgs Boson (80%), and Cosmogenesis (84%).
    *   Computational proofs have demonstrated the emergence of phenomena like the Higgs mass (~124.0 GeV), the speed of light, and Einstein's Field Equations from this framework.

### **III. Canonical Physics & Validated Models**

The system's implementation is grounded in rigorously validated physical models. The canonical, proven baseline is a first-order-in-time Reaction-Diffusion model.

**A. Reaction-Diffusion (RD) Model Validation**
The system's continuum limit is mapped to the Fisher-KPP equation (`∂t u = D ∂xx u + r u (1 - u)`), and its implementation is validated against two theoretical predictions:
1.  **Front Speed:** The propagation speed of a pulled front matches the theoretical value `c = 2√(Dr)` with a relative error of ~4.7% and R² fit > 0.999.
2.  **Dispersion Relation:** The growth rate `σ` of Fourier modes with wavenumber `k` matches the theoretical relation `σ(k) = r − D k²` with a median relative error of ~0.14% and R² > 0.999.

**B. Memory-Driven Steering**
A separate, falsifiable mechanism describes how a slow "memory" field `M` steers faster dynamic processes on the graph.
*   **Core Dynamics:**
    *   A **slow memory field `M`** evolves via a PDE incorporating write, decay, and consolidation: `∂_t M = γ R − δ M + κ ∇² M`, where `R` is a usage proxy and `∇²` is the graph Laplacian (`L = D - A`).
    *   A **fast steering law** defines a refractive index `n = exp(η M)`, causing paths to bend towards memory gradients (`r'' ∝ ∇_⊥ M`). On the graph, this is discretized as a softmax distribution over neighbor memory values: `P(i→j) ∝ exp(Θ m_j)`.
*   **Dimensionless Groups & Predictions:** The system is characterized by four dimensionless groups (`Θ`, `D_a`, `Λ`, `Γ`) governing steering strength, write gain, decay, and consolidation. Falsifiable predictions, which have been experimentally validated, include:
    1.  **Junction Choice:** Fork choice probabilities collapse to a logistic function `σ(Θ Δm)`.
    2.  **Curvature Scaling:** Path curvature scales linearly with the transverse memory gradient.
    3.  **Stability Band:** Persistent memory forms when write gain dominates decay (`D_a ≳ Λ`) and consolidation (`Γ`) is within an intermediate range.

### **IV. Computational Substrate & Dynamics**

The FUM is simulated on a dynamic graph structure, or "Substrate," with a highly scalable, production-oriented runtime.

**A. System Architecture & Core Principles**
The system is implemented in the `fum_rt` codebase, orchestrated by a **Nexus** module that manages the main simulation loop. A key design philosophy is being **"void-faithful,"** emphasizing local, event-driven updates over expensive global state scans. The architecture is undergoing a refactoring from a monolithic Nexus to a modular design with strict separation of concerns (`core` for pure numerics, `runtime` for orchestration, `io` for I/O). The system supports both a dense `Connectome` for validation and a default `SparseConnectome` for production. High-performance is a design goal, with C++/HIP placeholders for future GPU acceleration.

**B. Core Substrate & Neuron Model**
The substrate is a network of Exponential Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) neurons, with a fixed 80% excitatory/20% inhibitory composition, initialized as a k-NN graph. It supports both CPU (NumPy/SciPy) and GPU (PyTorch) backends. The neuron dynamics are governed by parameters such as membrane time constant (`tau_m`), resting/threshold/reset potentials, and refractory period. Plasticity mechanisms include:
*   **Intrinsic Plasticity:** A homeostatic mechanism adjusting `v_thresh` and `tau_m` to maintain firing rates in a 0.1-0.5 Hz target range.
*   **Synaptic Scaling:** Multiplicatively scales incoming excitatory weights to maintain network stability.

**C. Connectome Update & Rewiring**
At each simulation tick, the connectome state evolves via the following sequence:
1.  **Elemental Deltas:** Two vectors, `d_alpha` (`delta_re_vgsp`) and `d_omega` (`delta_gdsp`), are computed from the void equations.
2.  **Candidate Selection:** Vose's Alias Method is used to sample candidate nodes for new connections in `O(1)` time, with probability proportional to `ReLU(d_alpha)`.
3.  **Affinity Scoring:** For each node `i` and candidate neighbor `j`, an affinity score is calculated: `S_ij = ReLU(Δα_i) * ReLU(Δα_j) − λ * |Δω_i − Δω_j|`.
4.  **Top-k Rewiring:** The adjacency structure is updated by connecting each node to its top `k` neighbors with the highest affinity, forming a symmetric, undirected graph.
5.  **Node Field Update:** The node state vector `W` is updated via `dW = universal_void_dynamics(...)`, with the update multiplicatively gated by a scalar `sie_drive` signal.

**D. Dynamic Growth & Structural Homeostasis**
The substrate can grow dynamically ("hypertrophy") based on homeostatic principles.
*   **Growth Arbiter:** The `GrowthArbiter` module monitors network stability (cohesion, weight/synapse count, topological complexity). Once stable, the system accumulates "Void Debt" from a residual valence signal.
*   **Neurogenesis/Hypertrophy:** When accumulated debt crosses a threshold, new neurons are added. Crucially, their initial connections are not random but are formed by evolving a potential connection matrix for one step using the `universal_void_dynamics` equations.
*   **Structural Homeostasis:** A separate process maintains topological health using TDA metrics. It prunes weak synapses (weight < 10% of mean absolute weight) and heals fragmentation by creating "bridges" of new connections between disconnected components.

### **V. System Introspection, Control, and Motivation**

The system features sophisticated mechanisms for self-observation, runtime configuration, and intrinsic motivation, all designed to be scalable and "void-faithful."

**A. Event-Driven Introspection**
Global state scans are avoided in favor of local, event-driven processes.
*   **Void-Walkers (Scouts):** Read-only agents (`HeatScout`, `CycleHunterScout`, `FrontierScout`, etc.) with traversal budgets explore the connectome using local rules. They operate under a strict microsecond time budget.
*   **Announce Bus:** Scouts publish compact `Observation` events to a lock-free, bounded message queue that drops old events to prevent backpressure.
*   **Active Domain Cartography (ADC):** This module consumes `Observation` events to incrementally build a high-level map of the connectome's "Territories" and "Boundaries" without inspecting the full graph.

**B. Self-Improvement Engine (SIE) & Intrinsic Motivation**
The SIE provides a global valence/reward signal that gates growth and plasticity.
*   **Legacy SIE:** Blended `td_error`, `novelty`, `habituation`, and `self_benefit` (1 - density).
*   **SIE v2 (Void-Faithful):** Computes per-neuron rewards and a smoothed scalar valence directly from the `W` and `dW` vectors, using an EMA of `|dW|` for habituation and a TD-like term for prediction error, avoiding aggregate metrics.

**C. Runtime Control & State Management**
*   **Configuration:** The runtime is launched via `run_nexus.py` with command-line arguments (`--neurons`, `--k`, `--hz`, `--domain`).
*   **Live Control:** The Nexus orchestrator polls a `phase.json` file, allowing for dynamic, live reconfiguration of parameters without a restart.
*   **Checkpointing:** The system's state ("engram") is periodically saved to disk, defaulting to HDF5 (`.h5`) and falling back to NumPy (`.npz`).

### **VI. Input/Output and Cognitive Functions**

The system features a modular I/O pipeline for interacting with external data and generating autonomous, structured output.

**A. I/O Pipeline**
*   **Input (UTE):** The Universal Temporal Encoder ingests data from `stdin` and a `chat_inbox.jsonl` file, placing inputs into a thread-safe queue. It also generates a 1 Hz synthetic "tick" as a heartbeat.
*   **Output (UTD):** The Universal Transduction Decoder emits structured events to `stdout` and `utd_events.jsonl`. It manages a persistent `macro_board.json` defining actions like `say`, `think`, and `vars`.
*   **Logging:** A robust `RollingJsonlWriter` manages log files, archiving older segments to prevent unbounded growth.

**B. Autonomous Text Generation**
The system can generate autonomous text by commenting on its own structural changes.
*   **Gating Mechanism:** The decision to speak requires two conditions: a topological "spike" detected in the cyclomatic complexity (`E_active − N + C_active`) by a `StreamingZEMA` (z-score detector), and a sufficient valence signal from the SIE.
*   **Speech Composition:** A hierarchical strategy is used: (1) attempt emergent generation from learned n-gram models, (2) fall back to filling phrase templates, (3) as a final resort, produce a keyword summary.
*   **Speech Scoring:** The novelty of generated text is scored using IDF from a learned lexicon, and the final score combines system valence and novelty.

### **VII. Speculative Physics & Future Work (Quarantined)**

A more speculative, non-canonical model is explicitly quarantined as future work and is not part of the validated baseline.

**A. Effective Field Theory (EFT) and Tachyonic Condensation**
This model explores a second-order-in-time, Klein-Gordon-like equation for the FUM's continuum limit.
*   **Theory:** It describes a tachyonic scalar field that undergoes condensation to a stable vacuum. The kinetic term and wave propagation speed (`c² = 2Ja²`) are rigorously derived from a discrete action on a lattice.
*   **Finite Geometry Analysis:** An advanced analysis studies the model in a finite cylindrical geometry. By solving for field modes using modified Bessel functions (`I_ℓ`, `K_ℓ`), the theory predicts tachyonic instabilities for specific tube radii. The quartic potential term stabilizes these modes via condensation, leading to a non-trivial energy minimum at an optimal radius, analogous to findings by Bordag (2024).

### **VIII. Engineering, Validation, and User Interface**

The project is supported by a mature engineering methodology, a comprehensive validation framework, and a full-featured user interface.

**A. Validation & Testing Framework**
A clear distinction exists between fast, headless unit tests (`pytest`) and larger physics benchmark scripts that produce figures and JSON logs for validation. A post-processing "Gravity Regression Pack" is used to analyze simulation outputs for GR-like behaviors (e.g., perihelion precession) and substrate integrity.

**B. Telemetry & Visualization Pipeline**
*   **Pipeline:** A non-blocking pipeline prepares system state for visualization. The `CoreEngine` generates raw float32 maps, which are quantized to a compact u8 format (`frame.v2`) with embedded scaling factors. This payload is pushed to a bounded ring buffer (`MapsRing`) for consumption by WebSocket or Redis stream forwarders.
*   **Layout & Rendering:** A custom `void_driven_layout` function uses the core void dynamics for organic graph layouts. Highly optimized 2D and interactive 3D (Plotly) rendering functions are provided.
*   **Data Export:** The connectome can be exported to a standardized JSON format for web visualizers or a compressed sparse row (CSR) `.npz` format for lossless reconstruction.

**C. Frontend Application**
A comprehensive, modular Dash-based web application provides live monitoring and control. It communicates with the backend via file I/O (`phase.json`, `chat_inbox.jsonl`). A `ProcessManager` handles launching and stopping simulation runs. The UI features panels for run configuration, live runtime controls, real-time charts, a chat interface, and a custom file picker.
