# VDM Codebase Census Report

**Repository**: https://github.com/justinlietz93/Prometheus_FUVDM  
**Audit Date**: 2024-12-27  
**HEAD Commit**: cc751434d0882d76cb36f1624c384d7a1c623da0  
**Python Version**: 3.12.3

## Executive Summary

This read-only audit examined the Prometheus FUVDM codebase to assess void-faithful contract compliance and identify blockers to intended features. The system demonstrates sophisticated event-driven architecture with sparse operations, but contains critical violations of the void-faithful contract (local, event-driven, single writer GDSP, budgets/hysteresis, no dense scans) that block scalability and void map features.

### Key Findings (10-bullet summary):

â€¢ **Architecture**: Well-structured event-driven system with void walkers, GDSP single-writer authority, and ADC territory tracking, but missing key integrations between text pipeline and core systems

â€¢ **Single-Writer Violations**: 7 high-risk GDSP bypasses found, including NetworkX direct mutations and evolutionary algorithm weight writes outside official GDSP authority

â€¢ **Dense-Scan Violations**: 10 operations violate no-dense contract, with global weight statistics (`W.mean()`) and full adjacency scanning (`np.where(A[i] > 0)`) in hot paths

â€¢ **Event System**: Robust bus architecture with proper TTL/budget mechanisms, but UTE/UTD text pipeline lacks integration with B1 gates and ADC territories  

â€¢ **Gating Infrastructure**: B1 detection with hysteresis (3.0/1.0), walker budgets (16 visits, 8 edges, 64 TTL), and ADC territory TTL present but underutilized

â€¢ **Neuron Diversity**: Limited to E/I classification (80/20) with Gaussian parameter noise; missing rhythmic, bursting, habituating, and mirror neuron types

â€¢ **Territory System**: Simple composite-key clustering instead of spatial algorithms (label-prop, k-hop, resistance distance), limiting advanced ADC features

â€¢ **Visualization**: Two layout systems available but both violate bounded operations with O(NÂ²) global recomputation, blocking real-time void map rendering

â€¢ **Missing Instrumentation**: No dry-run, telemetry, or profiling modes available, preventing runtime validation of void-faithful compliance

â€¢ **Morphology Recovery**: Limited evidence of historical morphological configurations; current thresholds (cosmic debt 0.84, pathology 0.7, B1 persistence 0.1) suggest parameter-driven emergence

## Detailed Findings

### [Repository Facts](RepoFacts.md)
Pure Python implementation using PyTorch, NetworkX, SciPy scientific stack. Well-organized module structure with clear separation between runtime (`fum_rt/`), theory (`derivation/`), and validation code.

### [Architecture Map](ArchitectureMap.md)  
Event-driven system with void walkers performing TTL-limited exploration, publishing observations to AnnounceBus, consumed by ADC for territory tracking. GDSP maintains single-writer authority for topology/weight mutations. UTE/UTD handle text I/O but lack integration with core systems.

### [Single-Writer Audit](WritePaths.csv) | [Bypass Analysis](GDSP_Bypass_Suspects.md)
Found 24 mutation paths: 12 legitimate GDSP operations, 12 bypasses. High-risk bypasses include NetworkX structural plasticity (`graph.add_edge()`) and evolutionary weight mutations. Physics modules contain bypasses but in validation context.

### [Dense-Scan Audit](NoDense_Findings.json) | [Analysis](NoDense_Findings.md)
Identified 10 violations of no-dense contract. High severity: global weight statistics in metrics hot path, dense adjacency scanning for neighbor extraction, GPU-CPU weight transfers. Medium severity: component analysis full-N iterations.

### [Event-Driven & Gating](Gating_And_Events.md)
Comprehensive event schema with VTTouchEvent, EdgeOnEvent, ADCEvent types. B1 gate with hysteresis (3.0 spike threshold, 1.0 hysteresis), walker budgets enforced, territory TTL implemented. Missing: UTE/UTD gate integration.

### [System Contracts](Contracts.md)
Well-defined bus schema (Observation events), ADC territory tracking with EWMA statistics, GDSP operations (homeostatic repair, growth, pruning). Missing: explicit operation budgets, atomic transaction semantics.

### [Metrics Capabilities](Metrics_Capabilities.md)
Available: B1 topology proxy, ADC territory tracking, GDSP change reporting, physics validation metrics. Missing: edits-to-green counter, dense operation counter, coupling strength metrics, morphology signatures.

### [Morphology Provenance](Morphology_Diff.md)
Limited historical evidence. Found cosmogenesis code with critical debt threshold (0.84), TDA pathology thresholds (0.7), suggesting morphological emergence depends on RE-VGSP/GDSP balance and time dynamics enablement.

### [UTE/UTD Pipeline](UTE_UTD_Status.md)
Simple input/output routing with macro system. Missing expected stages (pointer-first, draft, repair, commit) and gate integration. No B1/ADC influence on text processing decisions.

### [Neuron Heterogeneity](Heterogeneity_ADC.md)
Basic diversity: E/I classification, Gaussian parameter noise (tau_m, v_thresh), intrinsic plasticity. Missing specialized types (rhythmic, bursting, habituating). ADC uses composite-key clustering, missing spatial algorithms.

### [Visualization Assessment](Visualization_Path.md)
Two layout systems: NetworkX spring layout (O(NÂ²)) and void-driven force simulation (O(iterations Ã— NÂ²)). Both violate bounded operations. Dashboard time series safe for hot path.

### [Runtime Probe](Run_Snapshot.md)
No ready-made instrumentation available. Smallest config (`1kN_sparse.json`) exists but lacks dry-run/telemetry modes. Missing performance counters, profiling flags.

## Priority Blockers

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Void-Faithful Contract Violations)
1. **Global weight statistics** in metrics hot path - breaks bounded operations
2. **Dense adjacency scanning** for sparse neighbor extraction - O(NÂ²) violation  
3. **NetworkX GDSP bypasses** - violates single-writer authority
4. **Visualization layout recomputation** - O(NÂ²) in potential hot paths

### ðŸŸ¡ High (Architecture Gaps)
1. **Missing UTE/UTD gate integration** - text pipeline isolated from core systems
2. **Component analysis scans** - full-N iterations in connectivity tracking
3. **Missing runtime instrumentation** - no observability into void-faithful compliance

### ðŸŸ¢ Medium (Feature Limitations)  
1. **Simplistic territory algorithms** - limits scalability of ADC features
2. **Limited neuron diversity** - reduces biological plausibility
3. **Evolutionary algorithm bypasses** - contained to validation context

## Recommended Actions

### [Top-3 Next Moves](NextMoves.md)

**Move 1** (2 days): Replace global statistics with bounded sampling in metrics
**Move 2** (3 days): Enforce single-writer authority through GDSP interface  
**Move 3** (2 days): Integrate B1/ADC gates into UTE/UTD text pipeline

These moves address the highest-impact void-faithful violations while unlocking advanced features like void maps, hierarchical bus/scoreboard, and adaptive text behavior.

## Conclusion

The FUVDM codebase demonstrates sophisticated understanding of void-faithful principles with strong event-driven architecture, proper single-writer authority (GDSP), and bounded walker operations. However, critical violations in metrics collection and visualization systems block scalability, while missing integrations prevent advanced features like adaptive text behavior and real-time void maps.

The recommended three-move sequence addresses the highest-impact violations while unlocking the intended feature set within a 1-week timeline. Success would establish FUVDM as a fully void-faithful system capable of supporting advanced morphological dynamics and hierarchical intelligence emergence.
