## Risk Categories

### ðŸ”´ High Severity (Immediate Action Required)
**Global Operations in Hot Paths**: Break fundamental void-faithful contracts
- Global weight statistics during metrics collection
- Dense adjacency scanning for sparse neighbor extraction  
- Full GPU weight matrix transfers
- NetworkX direct graph mutations bypassing GDSP
- Visualization layout recomputation

**Impact**: Core system violations, performance degradation, contract violations

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Severity (Short-term Planning)
**Architecture Gaps**: Missing key integrations and bounded operations  
- UTE/UTD pipeline lacks gate integration with B1/ADC systems
- Component analysis requires full-node iteration
- Missing runtime instrumentation for observability
- Territory algorithms don't leverage spatial structure

**Impact**: Reduced functionality, missed optimization opportunities, debugging difficulties

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Severity (Long-term Enhancement)
**Feature Limitations**: Missing capabilities that could improve system richness
- Physics modules bypass GDSP (validation context)
- Limited neuron type diversity beyond excitatory/inhibitory
- Advanced visualization not integrated with main loop

**Impact**: Limited feature set, reduced biological plausibility

## Fix ROI Analysis

### High ROI (High Impact, Low Effort)
1. **Replace `W.mean()` with sampling** - Quick win for metrics void-compliance
2. **Flag physics bypasses as validation-only** - Simple containment fix  
3. **Disable visualization in main loop** - Immediate hot path protection

### Medium ROI (Balanced Impact/Effort)
1. **Route evolutionary algorithms through GDSP** - Architectural fix with medium effort
2. **Implement sparse-native B1 calculation** - Avoids dense adjacency scanning
3. **Add B1/ADC gate integration to UTE/UTD** - Enables proper event-driven text processing

### Low ROI (High Effort, Future Value)
1. **Implement spatial territory algorithms** - Major ADC overhaul
2. **Add diverse neuron types** - Extensive substrate enhancement  
3. **Create incremental visualization system** - Complex rendering architecture

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Immediate Fixes Enable
- **Metrics sampling** â†’ Enables hot path void-compliance
- **GDSP bypass containment** â†’ Enables single-writer guarantee
- **Layout computation removal** â†’ Enables bounded visualization

### Sequential Requirements  
1. **Hot path fixes** must precede performance optimization
2. **Single-writer enforcement** must precede advanced plasticity features
3. **Event-driven infrastructure** must precede real-time adaptivity

## Estimated Timeline Impact

### Sprint 1 (2-3 days): Critical Violations
- Fix global statistics (replace with sampling)
- Contain GDSP bypasses (flag as validation-only)
- Remove hot path layout computation

### Sprint 2 (1-2 weeks): Architecture Gaps  
- Implement sparse-native operations
- Add UTE/UTD gate integration
- Create runtime instrumentation infrastructure

### Sprint 3+ (Long-term): Enhancement Features
- Spatial territory algorithms
- Advanced neuron type diversity
- Incremental visualization system

## Success Metrics

### Void-Faithful Compliance
- Zero global operations in hot paths
- All topology/weight mutations via GDSP
- All operations bounded by budgets/TTL
- Event-driven architecture throughout

### Performance Indicators
- Consistent O(E) or better complexity for core operations
