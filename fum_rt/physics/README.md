# Runtime Based Physics Gates

This fum_rt/physics/ folder intends to apply the physics derivations findings directly to the AI model at runtime to determine if the AI model does in fact use and display these physical behaviors. Currently, the runtime code is in a state of disarray due to a messy migration that is simultaneously trying to undo technical debt.
