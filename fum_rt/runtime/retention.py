"""
Runtime retention policy seam (Phase B): pure helper for checkpoint pruning.

Goals:
- Mirror Nexus inline retention logic exactly (move-only).
- No logging or external IO besides file deletions.
- Return a small summary dict so callers can decide how/what to log.

Usage pattern (as in Nexus today, adapted to this helper):
    path = save_checkpoint(run_dir, step, connectome, fmt=fmt, adc=adc)
    summary = prune_checkpoints(run_dir, keep=checkpoint_keep, last_path=path)
    # optional: logger.info("checkpoint_retention", extra={"extra": summary})

Behavior:
- If keep is falsy or <= 0, no action (returns {"kept": 0, "removed": 0, "ext": ext}).
- Determines extension from last_path.
- Keeps the most recent <= keep checkpoints based on numeric step parsed from filenames.
- Files are expected to be named "state_<step><ext>" as produced by the legacy saver.

    Enforce rolling checkpoint retention in run_dir using the same rules as Nexus.

        last_path: the full path returned by the last save_checkpoint call (to derive extension)
