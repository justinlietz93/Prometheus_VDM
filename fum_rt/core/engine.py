Core seam: temporary adapter that forwards to existing Nexus internals without changing behavior.

Phase B goal:
- Define a stable Core API now to avoid rework later.
- Do NOT move logic yet; keep Nexus as source of truth.
- These methods either delegate to existing functions or act as explicit stubs.

Seam policy:
- This module must not import from fum_rt.io.* or fum_rt.runtime.* to keep core isolated.
- Only depend on fum_rt.core.* and the Nexus-like object passed at construction.
