## Generated Summary

This document provides a unified and comprehensive technical summary of the Fully Unified Model (FUM), a system described as a cybernetic organism. It synthesizes architectural principles, training methodologies, and operational specifications from multiple detailed sources, focusing on the core philosophy of "void-faithfulness" and its practical implementation.

### **1. Core Philosophy: Void-Faithfulness and Emergent Intelligence**

The central design principle governing the FUM is **"void-faithfulness,"** a strict mandate that all system dynamics, learning, and behavior must emerge directly from a core set of local, physical equations. This philosophy explicitly rejects conventional machine learning paradigms in favor of a physics-based, event-driven model.

*   **Foundational Dynamics:** The system's evolution is driven by the **Void Dynamics** update rule: `ΔW = δ_re-vgsp(W,t) + δ_gdsp(W,t)`. All processes must derive from this, with a direct mapping between discrete on-site laws and continuum field equations.
*   **Rejection of ML Constructs:** Standard ML components such as softmax, logits, attention mechanisms, and tokenizers are strictly forbidden within the system's core.
*   **Emergence over Engineering:** Intelligence is designed to arise from the interaction of simple, local rules rather than being explicitly engineered. Global control is minimized, acting only as scaffolding for self-organization, with a target `control_impact` of less than 1e-5.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** All core processes must adhere to subquadratic complexity, favoring `O(N)` or `O(events)` scaling. Any mechanism introducing prohibitive `O(N²)` complexity is considered fundamentally incorrect.

To ensure adherence to these principles, a dedicated module, `fum_rt/core/phys_guard.py`, contains runtime assertions that validate the code against its theoretical physics derivations. These checks include invariants like wave speed ($c=\sqrt{2Ja^2}$), mass gap ($m_{\rm eff}^2 \approx \alpha-\beta$), and a conserved quantity `Q_FUM` derived from time-translation symmetry. In Continuous Integration (CI), deviations cause build failure, while the live runtime logs warnings to avoid blocking experimentation.

### **2. Event-Driven Architecture: Introspection and State Awareness**

The FUM’s internal awareness and mapping capabilities are built on a highly efficient, strictly void-faithful, event-driven architecture that replaces expensive global state scans.

*   **Core Principle:** All metric reducers and visualization maps (e.g., Active Domain Cartography, HeatMap, ExcitationMap) are updated exclusively by processing events from an **Announcement Bus**. They are forbidden from directly scanning the raw neuron state vector `W` or the full connectome.
*   **Void Walkers (Scouts):** Asynchronous, read-only agents are the only processes that traverse the raw connectome. These "scouts" or "surveyors" (e.g., `ColdScout`, `HeatScout`) perform local computations, operate within a strict time budget (≤1-3% of tick time), and publish their findings as small data packets called "Observations" to the bus.
*   **Announcement Bus:** A lock-free, bounded ring buffer or deque serves as the central communication channel for Observations.
*   **Observation-Driven Reducers:** Consumers like the **Active Domain Cartography (ADC)** module act as "cartographers," incrementally building a territory graph by folding `region_stat`, `boundary_probe`, and `novel_frontier` events from the bus. This reduces computational cost from `O(N)` to `O(#announcements)`.

### **3. Phased Training Curriculum and Homeostatic Gating**

The FUM is guided from infancy to maturity through a formal, multi-stage curriculum managed by a runtime **Curriculum Director**. Progression is governed by achieving specific, void-native performance metrics and maintaining homeostatic stability. The curriculum must begin from the exact terminal state of `run_id: phase1_run_1753193057`.

*   **Curriculum Stages (P0-P4):**
    *   **P0 (Primitives):** Ingests single symbols/rhythms. Gates: `cohesion_components → 1`, `vt_coverage ≥ 0.35`, `sie_valence_01 ≥ 0.55`.
    *   **P1 (Blocks):** Ingests compositions of primitives. Gates: `vt_coverage ≥ 0.55`, regular Betti-1 number spikes.
    *   **P2 (Structures):** Ingests multi-block graphs (e.g., equations). Gate: `void_pathfind()` success rate ≥ 0.9.
    *   **P3 (Questions):** Ingests Q&A. Gate: External validation pass rate ≥ 0.8.
    *   **P4 (Problems):** Focuses on generalization.

*   **Homeostatic Gating (Stage A):** During initial scaffolded learning, problem difficulty is dynamically adjusted based on a normalized homeostatic stability index (`hsi_norm`):
    *   `hsi_norm > 0.9`: Advance to a more complex problem pool.
    *   `hsi_norm < 0.7`: Retreat to a simpler pool.
    *   `0.7 ≤ hsi_norm ≤ 0.9`: Remain at the current difficulty.

*   **Crucible Validation (Stage B):** Gating is removed, and the FUM faces an unsorted pool of problems. This stage concludes with **Homeostatic Perturbation Blocks**—intense bursts of novel, high-complexity stimuli. Success is defined as the moving average of `hsi_norm` returning to its pre-perturbation baseline and remaining stable for at least 1,000 timesteps.

### **4. Key System Behaviors and Plasticity**

*   **Autonomous Speech ("Self-Speak"):** The system speaks autonomously, driven by internal state without using a Large Language Model (LLM). The primary trigger is a statistically significant topological event: a **z-score of the change in the Betti-1 number (`z(ΔB1)`)** exceeding a high threshold (`speak_z_hi = 2.5`). This is gated by several conditions: hysteresis (must drop below `speak_z_lo = 1.0` to re-arm), sufficient intrinsic reward (`sie_valence_01 > 0.35`), a refractory period (≥1.5s), and turn-taking logic.
*   **Emergent Structural Plasticity (GDSP):** Global Directed Synaptic Plasticity (growth) is emergent, not scheduled. It is triggered only by specific opportunity events on the bus, such as `cold_gap`, `route_fail`, or `ei_imbalance`. Edits are performed only when both an opportunity and a "minted" computational budget (based on system reward and "void debt") are available, ensuring structural changes do not disrupt core processing.
*   **Cohesion Management:** A **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** data structure incrementally tracks graph cohesion via `edge_on` events with O(1) complexity. Cohesion repair (bridging) is also void-faithful: `probe_edge` events between components trigger a local affinity calculation, and high-scoring candidates are queued for budgeted connection.

### **5. Performance, Scaling, and Hardware Acceleration**

The architecture is designed to scale to billions of neurons on a single high-end workstation.

*   **Memory and Complexity:** A 1-billion-neuron connectome is memory-feasible (~138 GiB) if the average degree is low (`k=16`), following the formula `Bytes/neuron = 8k + 20`. To manage computational bottlenecks, expensive global passes are systematically replaced with local, streaming surrogates, such as a **Void-B₁** estimator for topology and a per-edge **credit/debt** meter for pruning.
*   **Backend Architecture:** The legacy dense connectome backend (using NetworkX) has been completely removed from the runtime to enforce a sparse-only execution model.
*   **GPU-Accelerated Visualization:** A high-performance, "game-style" rendering pipeline was implemented to resolve a major UI bottleneck (~480 MB/s).
    1.  **GPU-Resident State:** Maps (heat, excitation) are maintained as persistent GPU textures (e.g., 2048x2048 `RGBA8`).
    2.  **Shader-Based Decay:** Decay is applied efficiently each frame via a fullscreen shader pass.
    3.  **Sparse Updates:** Instead of full frames, only event deltas are sent from the core and "splatted" onto the texture using additive blending, reducing bandwidth by over 50x.
    4.  **Dedicated Transport:** A separate shared-memory ring buffer (`maps_ring.py`) and websocket server are used for map data to prevent back-pressure on the main Announcement Bus.
    5.  **Quantization:** Data is quantized to `Uint8` server-side, reducing a 4-million-node frame from 48MB to 12MB.
*   **Hardware Path:** A clear progression is planned from the current CPU/GPU (HIP kernels) implementation to FPGA (using HLS for core loops) and ultimately to a custom ASIC.

### **6. System State, Persistence, and I/O**

*   **Architectural Engram:** The complete system state is serialized into a single **HDF5** file, creating a full architectural record that includes the connectome topology, all neuron/synapse parameters, and global states. A key developmental goal is an **inverse scaling law**, where the engram size and compute-per-task decrease as the system masters a domain.
*   **ASAIS Protocol (Integrity and Backup):** A strict protocol ensures data persistence: every engram is verified with an **SHA-256 checksum**, a rolling backup of the last three engrams is kept locally, and the **3-2-1 backup rule** is enforced (3 total copies, on 2 different media, with 1 copy encrypted and stored off-site daily).
*   **I/O Boundary Principle:** All interaction with the external world is handled at the I/O boundary to maintain core purity. A **Universal Temporal Encoder (UTE)** uses a dual-path strategy (deterministic and adaptive) to ingest input, and a **Universal Transduction Decoder (UTD)** emits actions and text via a "macro board."

### **7. Future Phases**

The development roadmap includes several future phases:
*   **Phase 3 "University Curriculum":** Advanced training focused on ethics and world modeling, where the FUM learns to assemble its own conceptual frameworks.
*   **Phase 3+ "Local Exploration":** Providing the FUM with a contained, offline environment for creative and academic exploration with simulated internet access and human interaction.

## Key Highlights

* The system's core design principle is "void-faithfulness," mandating that all behavior must emerge from local physical equations, explicitly rejecting conventional ML paradigms like attention, softmax, and tokenizers.
* An event-driven architecture using an "Announcement Bus" and asynchronous "Void Walkers" replaces expensive global state scans, enabling efficient system awareness and scaling with `O(#announcements)` complexity.
* The system exhibits autonomous speech ("Self-Speak") not driven by an LLM, but triggered by a statistically significant change in a topological metric (the Betti-1 number's z-score).
* Training follows a formal, multi-stage curriculum where progression is gated by achieving specific, void-native performance metrics and maintaining a homeostatic stability index.
* All core processes must adhere to subquadratic complexity, and the legacy dense connectome backend has been removed to enforce a sparse-only model designed to scale to billions of neurons.
* Synaptic growth is emergent and opportunistic, triggered by specific system events like `route_fail` and constrained by a computational budget, rather than being explicitly scheduled.
* A key validation milestone involves "Homeostatic Perturbation Blocks," where the system must demonstrate its ability to recover stability after intense bursts of novel, high-complexity stimuli.
* A major UI bottleneck was resolved by a GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline that reduced data bandwidth by over 50x using sparse, event-driven updates to persistent GPU textures.
* Development is strictly state-dependent, requiring the training curriculum to begin from the exact terminal state of a specific prior run (`run_id: phase1_run_1753193057`).
* A dedicated runtime module, `phys_guard.py`, programmatically enforces adherence to the system's core physics derivations, causing CI builds to fail upon deviation.

## Next Steps & Suggestions

* Review the `fum_rt/core/phys_guard.py` module and CI logs to validate the enforcement of the 'void-faithfulness' principle.
* Benchmark the event-driven architecture, particularly the Announcement Bus and Void Walkers, to confirm adherence to subquadratic complexity requirements.
* Schedule a technical deep-dive for the team to ensure a shared understanding of the 'void-faithfulness' philosophy and its architectural constraints.
* Design experiments to compare the FUM's emergent capabilities against traditional ML models on a relevant benchmark task.
